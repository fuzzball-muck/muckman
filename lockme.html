<p><b>1.5.3  Locking Yourself</b></p>

<p>On some <code>M*</code> servers, locking yourself is a very
worthwhile precaution, preventing other players from taking things from
you or picking you up.  On <code>MUCKs,</code> locking yourself really isn't
crucial. The server won't let you pick up players, and it won't let you
take things being held by other players. If you are not locked, people
<em>can</em> `rob' you, which means that they take one of your pennies.
Most players have several thousand more pennies than they need.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, you can lock yourself by typing <code>@lock me =
me</code>. (Locks are discussed in <a href="locks.html">Section
2</a>.)</p>

<p>A more practical issue is that of `handing' and `throwing'. You may
or may not wish to allow people to hand and throw things to you. Both are
convenient, but it is possible to abuse the <code>hand</code> and
<code>throw</code> commands.  Abuses range from throwing objects to someone
who does not wish to be disturbed (a minor annoyance) to handing someone an
innocuous looking object that can eavesdrop on their conversations (an offense
that merits being banned from the <code>MUCK</code>). Most players do allow
handing and throwing.</p>

<p>To allow handing, type <code>hand #ok</code>. To allow throwing, type
<code>throw</code> #ok</code> and <code>@set me = J</code>. To disallow
them, type <code>hand #!ok</code> and/or <code>throw #!ok</code>. Both
are disallowed by default. (<code>hand</code> and <code>throw</code> are
user-created commands, but most <code>MUCKs</code> have them.)</p>
