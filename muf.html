<p><b>3.2  Overview: MUF</b></p>

<p><code>MUF</code> &#151; a dialect of <code>FORTH</code> &#151; is one
of two programming languages implemented on all <code>MUCKs,</code> the
other being <code>MPI.</code> The speed and efficiency of
<code>MUF</code> make <code>MUCKs</code> readily user-extensible:
powerful new commands and programs can be soft-coded into the database.
Although the only place you'll be able to use it is on
<code>MUCKs,</code> <code>MUF</code> is a real programming language:
once you've learned it, you can truthfully say you know how to program
computers, and concepts and habits of thought you pick up as a Mucker
will be useful in learning languages with widespread <code>RL</code>
applications.

<p><code>MUF</code> is an extensible, structured, stack-based, compiled
language. 

<dl>
    <p><dt><em>Extensible</em>: 
      <dd>If there isn't a command to do what you want, you can make
      one.</p>

    <p><dt><em>Structured</em>: 
      <dd>A <code>MUF</code> program consists of `functions' or `words'
      ... blocks of code that are executed as a unit and `call' each
      other as needed.  It doesn't matter (to the computer) whether you
      put all your code on one long line or every word on a new line (it
      matters a lot to people who are trying to read your code). White
      space (any combination of spaces, tabs, or new lines) separates
      words, and the order of the words and their positioning between
      the symbols that start and end a function are what matter. The
      program is composed of `functions' or `words' that each perform a
      specific task.</p> 

    <p><dt><em>Stack-based</em>: 
      <dd>You do everything by manipulating a stack, a set of
      `last-in-first-out' values like HP calculators use.</p>
        
    <p><dt><em>Compiled</em>: 
      <dd>You write a program that people can read, with semi-normal
      words like <code>pop</code> and <code>rot</code> and
      <code>remove_prop</code> (this is your source code) and then a
      part of the server, the <code>MUF</code> compiler, turns it into
      arcane stuff that computers can read (this is your object code).
      You won't ever see the object code.</p> </dl>

<p><b>Before You Begin:</b></p>

<p>In order to program in <code>MUF,</code> you'll need a Mucker bit, a
flag that lets you use the <code>MUF</code> editor. A wiz will need to
set this, so page one and ask. There are three levels of mucker bits,
<code>M1</code> (apprentice), <code>M2</code> (journeyman), and
<code>M3</code> (master) (wizards are considered <code>M4</code>). </p>

<p>As a new Mucker, you'll get an <code>M1</code> bit. <code>M1</code>'s
have access to most of the functions, but not all; output from an
<code>M1</code> program to anyone other than the owner of the program is
prefaced by the user's name; and the program won't be able to send
messages to or retrieve information from remote locations. An
<code>M1</code> bit is essentially <code>MUF</code> with training
wheels. Once you've written a couple <code>M1</code> programs that work,
you can show them to a wiz and ask for an <code>M2</code> bit.
<code>M2</code>'s can't use all the functions, but you can make truly
useful programs at the <code>M2</code> level: bulletin board or book
programs, specialized exits and locks, morphing programs, etc. </p>

<p><code>M3</code> bits are dandy to have, but they are hard to come by
on large mucks, and for good reason. An <code>M3</code> bit gives its
owner considerable power over the data base, approaching that of a
wizard: an inept or malintentioned <code>M3</code> coder could cause
serious problems. In fact, <code>M3</code>'s are in some ways more of a
security risk than Wizard bits: wiz bits are more powerful, but all
commands issued by a wizard are logged; this is not necessarily true of
<code>M3</code> programs and players. To get an <code>M3</code> bit on a
well established <code>MUCK,</code> you will need to write some very
good programs and have shown yourself to be a trustworthy player over
time. In general, it's easier to get an <code>M3</code> on newer,
smaller <code>MUCKs.</code> </p>

<p>There are two commands that are good to know Before you Begin. One is
<code>man,</code> the online manual command. Typing <code>man</code>
<code>pop</code> would tell you about the <code>MUF</code> primitive
<code>pop.</code> The other is <code>@q.</code> This aborts a foreground
program you have running. If you find yourself in a run-away or
locked-up program, type <code>@q</code> to get out of it.</p>
