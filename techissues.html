<p><b>5.1.1  Selecting a Site</b></p>

<p>Of the various matters you'll need to consider, selecting a site is
in many ways the easiest. You need a 7 x 24 connection to the Internet
and a stable <code>IP</code> address, for a machine running some version
of <code>UNIX,</code> with permission to run a constant process. This
may reduce the number of options to one or none. If it's one, the
decision is made: go with the site you have. If it is none, and you're
set on running a <code>MUCK,</code> your options are:</p>

<ol>
    <p><li>Buy 7 x 24 access, with a stable <code>IP</code> address. In
    most markets, at the current time, this costs about $100 per month.
    You will of course also need a computer at the receiving end of that
    connection.</p>

    <p><li>Find someone who will let you run a <code>MUCK</code> on
    their site. This is not impossible. Both requests and offers for
    sites appear rather frequently on the rec.games.mud.announce
    newsgroup.  Bulletin board posts and public shouts on large
    <code>M*'s</code> may well turn up altruists: the freeware and
    volunteerism ethos remains alive and well in the <code>M*</code>
    universe.</p>
</ol>

<p>If you are in the fortunate position of being able to choose sites,
consider the following factors:</p>

<ol>
    <p><li>Connection reliability, connection speed, and sizable
    <code>RAM</code> are all more important than processor speed. A
    <code>MUCK</code> can be run quite successfully on a `486 under
    Linux. A faster <code>CPU</code> is of course nicer, especially if
    you do other things on the machine, but in all likelihood, processor
    speed is the last bottleneck you'll hit.</p>

    <p><li>It's hard to judge connection reliability ahead of time. If
    you know someone who works on a site you're considering, or at least
    through the same <code>ISP,</code> solicit their feedback.</p>

    <p><li>Faster connection hardware is, obviously, better than slower
    hardware. A 28.8 modem is adequate, but an <code>ISDN</code> is
    better.  The new cable modem and <code>ASDN</code> links would work
    quite nicely. A <code>T1</code> or partial <code>T1</code>
    connection is also acceptable.</p>

    <p><li>Hardware is not the only consideration for connection speed.
    Some <code>ISP's</code> simply cannot provide reliably fast
    connections.  Sometimes this is their own fault (they sold more
    bandwidth than they have), and sometimes it's due to factors beyond
    their control (the <code>ISP's</code> <code>ISP</code> sold more
    bandwidth than <em>they</em> have, or the whole set up is situated
    behind some chronic bottleneck).  You can get a rough idea of
    comparative speeds by doing a traceroute to sites under
    consideration. The first hops shown will be those on your end of the
    connection, and are less relevant: other user's won't have to make
    those hops. The last several hops, however, are telling. If one site
    consistently posts better times than another on the last two or
    three hops, this is worth taking into consideration. Although the
    times you see are in scant milleseconds, final hops of more than 300
    - 400 milleseconds may indicate a bottleneck at the server.  Also,
    try pinging the sites (<code>ping &lt;address&gt;</code>) and comparing
    the indicated times. Let ping run for a couple minutes, then stop it
    with ctrl-c. You should see a percentage for `packets lost'.
    Dropped packets have to be resent, which significantly slows
    transmissions between a client and server.</p>

    <p><li>You need adequate <code>RAM.</code> <code>MUCK</code> is
    memory-based. That is, it keeps the database loaded in
    <code>RAM</code> while operating. If this results in a process
    larger than available <code>RAM,</code> portions of memory are
    frequently swapped to disk (`paged'). This causes a significant
    degradation in performance. So, have enough memory: for a small
    <code>MUCK,</code> it's not a lot. A dbase with 2500 objects should
    create a process of 4 - 4.5 megs.</p>

<p>The ideal is to run the <code>MUCK</code> on a machine that you own:
compiling the server will be considerably easier, and you'll be able to
restart the <code>MUCK</code> quickly in the case of a power outage or
other failure. Console access is also a significant security
consideration: see <a href="security.html">Section 5.1.4</a></p>
