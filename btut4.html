<p><b>Creating Rooms and Areas (cont'd)</b></p>

<p><em>Describing Rooms:</em></p>

<p>Room descs are a somewhat demanding genre. You need to convey a sharp sense
of place in a very brief space. You often need to describe a number of rooms
with similar characteristics without becoming repetitive. The description
often needs to incorporate cues that geographically orient the player. Since
other events online are competing for the reader's attention, your writing
needs to be exceptionally clear. The following discussion first covers
technical aspects of setting room descs, then offers some editorial
suggestions for writing them. </p>

<p>As with any other object, the description of a room can be set with the
<code>@desc</code> command. And, as with any other object, you may want to do
some hanky-panky with <code>lsedit</code> and <code>MPI</code> to provide
formatting (indentation, paragraph breaks, etc.) or flexibility (dynamically
generated text describing the time of day, players present, or random events).
A desc string bracketted with an <code>MPI</code> <code>{eval}</code> function
will cause any <code>MPI</code> in the desc itself to be parsed. The following
description of the tavern uses this technique to include the names of present
players in the description.</p>

<p><code>
====================================<br>
&gt; @desc here = {eval:{list:maindesc,here}}<br>
&nbsp;  Description set.<br>
> lsedit here = maindesc<br>
<nobr>
&nbsp;  &lt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Welcome to the list editor.  You can get help by entering '.h'&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt; 
</nobr><br><nobr>
&nbsp;  &lt; '.end' will exit and save the list.  '.abort' will abort any
	changes. &gt; 
</nobr><br><nobr>
&nbsp;  &lt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To save changes to the list, and continue editing, use '.save'&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt; 
</nobr><br>
&nbsp;  &gt; Insert at line 1&gt; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tavern is little changed from days when pirate sloops found haven<br>
&nbsp; in the coves nearby: the beams are still low and smoke-stained, the tables<br>
&nbsp; still rough-hewn and knife-hacked, the floorboards still trecherously<br>
&nbsp; uneven. What light there is comes from three flickering oil-lamps and a<br>
&nbsp; sharp-scented wood fire burning steadily on the hearth.  Glasses and<br>
&nbsp; bottles along the back wall catch and toss the dim, moving light. The <br>
&nbsp; innkeeper standing easily behind the bar is a grave of secrets.<br>
&nbsp; {eval:{prop:_folks,here}}<br>
&nbsp; .end<br>
&nbsp;   &lt; Editor exited. &gt;<br>
&nbsp;   &lt; list saved. &gt;<br>
> @set here=_folks:{if:{commas:{lremove:{contents:here,player},{owner:me}}},<br>
&nbsp; {commas:{lremove:{contents:here,player},{owner:me}}, and ,item,{name:<br>
&nbsp; {&item}}} are here\, at various places in the room,Currently\, you're the
	<br>
&nbsp; only other one here}.  <br>
&nbsp; Property set.<br>
====================================
</code></p>

<p>If you don't want formatting such as paragraphs or the two-space
indentation in the example above, it would be more efficient <em>not</em> to
embed the desc in a list</p>

<p><code>
====================================<br>
> @desc here = The tavern is little changed from days when pirate sloops <br>
&nbsp; found haven in the coves nearby: the beams are still low and smoke-, <br>
&nbsp; stained, the tables still rough-hewn and knife-hacked, the floorboards <br>
&nbsp; still trecherously uneven. What light there is comes from three flickering<br>
&nbsp; oil-lamps and a sharp-scented wood fire burning steadily on the hearth.<br>
&nbsp; bottles along the back wall catch and toss the dim, moving light. The <br>
&nbsp; innkeeper standing easily behind the bar is a grave of secrets.
<br>
&nbsp; {eval:{prop:_folks,here}}<br>
&nbsp; Description set.<br>
====================================
</code></p>

Including queues that indicate looktraps and local commands is a common and
helpful convention. A clueful <code>MUCKer</code> would deduce from the
following room desc that it's worth taking a look at the innkeeper and sign:

<p><code>

&nbsp; still trecherously uneven. What light there is comes from three flickering<br>
&nbsp; oil-lamps and a sharp-scented wood fire burning steadily on the hearth.<br>
&nbsp; bottles along the back wall catch and toss the dim, moving light. The <br>
&nbsp; 'innkeeper' standing easily behind the bar is a grave of secrets.<br>
&nbsp; {eval:{prop:_folks,here}} There is a small 'sign' sitting <br>
&nbsp; on the end of the bar.<br>

<br>
&gt; is What will you have, stranger?<br>
&nbsp;  Ishmael growls, "What will you have, stranger?"<br>
====================================
</code></p>

<p>(Note that we avoided creating a puppet object for Ishmael... the room desc
says that he's here, and a named object in the room's contents list is not
really necessary for our purposes. Also, the two commands &#151; `ip' and `is'
&#151; are created using one exit object, and we could modify the action to
provide additional local commands using the multi-action technique discussed
in <a href="multiacttut.html">Section 4.2</a>. It is especially worthwhile to
follow such dbase-conserving practices when building large areas.)</p>

<p>Some builders feel that the obvious exit list after room descs is intrusive
and artificial looking. If you decide not to use an obvious exit list, you
should include text in the desc that will tell a careful reader which ways she
can go.</p>

&nbsp; {eval:{prop:_folks,here}} There is a small 'sign' sitting <br>

&nbsp; to the west; another, at the front of the tavern, opens onto
the<br>
&nbsp; village green.<br>

====================================
</code></p>

<p>Modern graphic workstations can display a huge amount of text, but the
standard computer terminal only displays a screen 80 characters wide and 24
lines tall. While standard character terminals may seem obsolete to some, it's
worthwhile to respect this `lowest common denominator': a number of people do
still access <code>M*'s</code> through standard terminals... either
<code>UNIX</code>/Linux computers on which they have chosen not to install or
run graphics, or virtual terminals being run from a shell account. Further,
the vast majority of these <code>UNIX</code> folks will be using
TinyFugue as their client.  With TinyFugue's `visual' mode turned on,
the bottom four lines are used as a typing window.  Additionally, not
all clients can display the full width of 80 characters. So, if you want
people to be able to see the entire desc in one screen (a good thing to
strive for), you should limit descriptions to a 78 x 20 field of text.
You can choose to violate this guideline, of course, and often will be
justified in doing so...  but be aware of the tradeoff you make.</p>

<p>A further `less-is-more' point: a common mistake made by new builders is to
create rooms that serve only to provide a way to get from point A to point B.
A forest path leading from the stream to the glade, a foyer leading from the
street to office lobby, etc. Such rooms (and the extra exits required to link
them) seldom earn their keep: they take up extra space in the database, eat up
your quota, and make the area feel bland or `loose'. As an alternative,
consider setting detailed <code>@succ</code> and <code>@drop</code> messages
that convey a sense of travel over a distance. Or, in cases where the effect
is still too fast and a greater sense of distance is required, consider
writing or using a program that generates a travel event of some sort (one
such program is provided <a href="slomo.html">here</a>).</p>
