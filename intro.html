<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>A <code>MUCK</code> is a computer-driven, text-based `world'. Users,
or `players', log on to the <code>MUCK</code> computer via the Internet,
and may then interact with other players. The program running the
<code>MUCK</code> and the computer it's on are both called the `server'.
Each player controls a `character', a virtual person or creature
inhabiting the world of the <code>MUCK</code>. Your character might be
very much like you, the player, or she might be very different.
<code>MUCK</code> is one member of a group related servers, including
<code>MUSH,</code> <code>MUX,</code> <code>MOO,</code>
<code>MUSE,</code> and <code>MUD;</code> collectively, these servers are
often referred to as <code>M*'s</code>, <code>MU*'s,</code> or
<code>M***'s.</code> </p>

<p>Everything is in text; there are no graphics. You will `see' things
from the perspective of your character: whatever place you're in will be
described, in words; people and things around you will also be
described, and you can look at them. Succinct commands let you say and
do things, interacting with other people on the <code>MUCK</code> (on a
small <code>MUCK,</code> this might be six other people; on a large one,
it might be 300). Some people view the text-only aspect of
<code>MUCK</code>s as a limitation, others as a very positive feature.
While a screen full of text lacks the instant impact of well done
graphics, the world that comes alive in your imagination can be more
vivid and colorful than anything computer graphics can produce. Just as
the words on the page `disappear' when one is immersed in a novel &#151;
and one instead imaginatively experiences the world described in the
book &#151; the words on your computer screen can `disappear', and you
imaginatively experience the world of the <code>MUCK</code>. Here,
though, you are an active participant rather than a passive
observer.</p>

<p><code>MUCK</code>s can be constructed to model any sort of world
imaginable, on any scale: a droplet populated by microbes, a one-room
bar, an undersea kingdom, or a far-flung stellar empire. By (recent)
historical accident, many <code>MUCK</code>s are worlds populated by
furries. A furry is an anthropomorphic animal, an animal with human
characteristics. You might meet an accountant or a college student on a
<code>MUCK</code>, but you're more likely to meet a suave wolf who likes
to quote poetry, or a tiger with a weakness for chocolate truffles. So,
yes, furries are inherently silly. But they are also inherently noble:
protean and indestructible, they embody who we might be in a world where
anything is possible.</p>
