<p><b>1.4.4  Seeing Who's Around</b></p>

<p>Space on the <code>MUCK</code> is divided into `rooms', which may or
not be described to resemble actual interior rooms. There may be
numereous people online, but not in the same room as you.</p>

<p>The names of characters in the same room as you will be appended to
the room's description in a list of the room's `Contents'. Some things
in the list may not be connected characters, however: some may be
things. some may be puppets, and some may be characters who are not
online (they're `asleep'). To get a list of online characters in the
same room, type <code>who</code> in lower case. In rooms set
<code>Dark,</code> the `Contents' list will not appear: there may or may not
be other players present.  Guest Rooms and New Player Start rooms are often
set <code>Dark.</code></p>

<p>To see who's online on the <code>MUCK</code> as a whole, type
<code>WHO</code>, all upper case, or <code>3who</code> for a shorter,
three-column list.</p>
