<h2>1.0  Basic Commands and Setting up a Character</h2>

<b>1.1  Some Terms and Abbreviations</b>

<p>Frequently used terms:</p>

<dl>
<p><dt>Player: <dd>The person reading this manual; the entity who types
things on behalf of a character.</p>

<p><dt>Character: <dd>The virtual person or creature inhabiting the
<code>MUCK,</code> controlled by a player. Players have characters;
characters have players.  The terms `player' and `character' are often
used interchangebly.</p>

<p><dt>Puppet: <dd>A player-like object controlled by a character. A
`virtual character', as it were. A puppet can move and act independently
of the character; everything the puppet sees and hears is relayed to the
character and player.</p>

<p><dt>Zombie: <dd>Same thing as a puppet.</p>

<p><dt>Robot (or `bot): <dd>An object programmed to act like a character, or 
a character under the control of a program that causes her to perform 
certain actions automatically. `Bots are sometimes called
<code>AI's</code> (from `artificial intelligence').</p>

<p><dt>Flag: <dd>A setting on an object that influences or restricts its 
behavior. Flags are also called `bits'. Flags are discussed in 
<a href="flags.html">Section 2.1</a>.</p>

<p><dt>Object Type: <dd>An object may be a <code>PLAYER,</code>
<code>THING,</code> <code>ROOM,</code> <code>EXIT,</code> or
<code>PROGRAM.</code> </p>

<p>A <code>PLAYER</code> is something that can be connected to via a name and
password, can own things, and can act independently. Because this object type
is called `player' rather than `character', many help documents (including
this manual) will often use this term, though what's meant is the character
object, not the living person who controls it. A <code>THING</code> is a
mobile object that may be picked up, dropped, handed, and otherwise
manipulated. A <code>ROOM</code> is a place in the world of the
<code>MUCK,</code> though it need not be described as an interior room: rooms
can also be described to simulate an outdoor area, or described in an abstract
way so that moving through the room shows characters useful text (for example,
a tutorial on building might be set up as a series of rooms, with the
description of each room serving as a `page' in a maunal).  An
<code>EXIT</code> is a link between two objects on the <code>MUCK.</code>
Exits may be created such that they serve as virtual doors between rooms, or
they may serve as user-created commands. (<code>EXITs</code> are also called
<code>ACTIONS</code>.) A <code>PROGRAM</code> is a special instance of class
<code>THING</code> which contains the code of an executable program. The type
of an object is determined when it is created, and indicated by a flag. An
object with a <code>P</code> flag is a <code>PLAYER</code>; an object with an
<code>R</code> flag is a <code>ROOM</code>; an object with an <code>E</code>
flag is an <code>EXIT</code>; an object with an <code>F</code> flag is a
program. If an object has none of these flags, it is a <code>THING</code> .
The collective term for all of these is is `object': players, rooms, etc. are
all objects.</p>

<p><dt>Dbref: <dd>Every object in the database has a unique identifying 
number: its `database reference number', or `dbref' for short. (Many objects 
may have the same name.) A dbref is usually preceeded by an # octothorpe, 
e.g. <code>#123.</code> </p>

<p><dt>Client: <dd>A program that replaces <code>Telnet</code> as a
means to connect to the <code>MUCK</code> server. Clients have numerous
special features specifically applicable to <code>M*'s,</code> such as
automated logon, the capacity to switch between several worlds, hiliting
certain kinds of text, line-wrapping, separating text being typed from
text being displayed by the <code>MUCK,</code> paging, and scrollback.
Different platforms require different clients.  <em>TinyFugue</em> is a
popular <code>UNIX</code> client. <em>MUDDweller</em> is a widely used
Macintosh client. <em>SimpleMU</em>, <em>Pueblo</em>, <em>Phoca</em>,
and <em>ZMud</em> are common Windows clients. A single client can
connect to different servers... that is, you don't need a separate
client for <code>MUSH,</code> <code>MUCK,</code> and <code>MUD.</code>
Virtually all client programs are distributed as freeware or shareware,
and are widely available over the Internet (see <a
href="appenda.html">Appendix A</a>).</p>

<p><dt>Penny: <dd>The unit of currency on a <code>MUCK.</code> Money is
usually a non-issue on <code>MUCKs,</code> though some commands require
an expenditure of pennies. The administrators of a <code>MUCK</code> may
set the name of the currency: it might be pennies, or it might be
pop-tarts, fleas, or lurid fantasies. You will often find money simply
by moving through the <code>MUCK,</code> and will see a message such as
`You find a penny!' or `You find a reason for living!' Many
<code>MUCKs</code> also have banks or other places where you can get
more pennies.</p>

<p><dt>Save: <dd>A period in which the server backs up the database to disk.
At scheduled intervals, the server automatically executes relatively brief
saves in which only those objects changed or created since the last save are
backed up (`delta saves'), as well as longer saves in which the entire database
is backed up ('full saves' or `database saves').  In addition to automated
saves, wizards may initiate a save via the <code>@dump</code> command. ('Saves'
are also called `dumps'.) During a save, activity on the <code>MUCK</code> is
frozen: commands you enter during a save will be queued and executed after the
save completes. On a very large <code>MUCK,</code> a full save can take ten or
more minutes.</p>

<p><dt>Lag: <dd>(noun) A perceptible delay between the time you enter a 
command and the time it is executed. Lag may be caused by an overloaded server 
(too many people logged on or too many programs running), by an overly 
large database (the database is larger than available RAM, necessitating 
frequent swaps to disk), or by problems on the Internet. (verb) To 
experience lag or a `locked-up' screen.</p>

<p><dt>Spam: <dd>(noun) Text scrolling by too fast to be read comfortably. 
(verb) To act or use programs in such a way that those around you are 
subjected to an excessive amount of frivolous or repetitive text.</p>

<p><dt>Idle: <dd>To be logged onto the <code>MUCK</code> but not doing
anything.</p>

<p><dt>Mav: <dd>To say aloud something meant to be whispered. By extention, 
to say aloud something meant to be paged, or to whisper or page to 
the wrong person. Maving is a potential source of embarrassment or 
awkwardness. The name derives from a character in the early days of 
<code>M*s</code> who was chronically prone to this particular faux pas.</p>

<p><dt>God: <dd>The <code>MUCK's</code> overall controller or
administrator, and the player object with dbref <code>#1.</code> God has
access to a few commands unavailable to all other players, and may not
be <code>@forced.</code> The term `God' is used less frequently on
<code>MUCKs</code> than on <code>MUSHes</code> and <code>MUDs.</code> In fact,
leadership by a single wizard player is relatively rare. More often, a core
group of wizards share responsibility for administering the <code>MUCK,</code>
with each having access to the God character's password.</p>

<p><dt>Wizard: <dd>An administrator of the <code>MUCK,</code> and a
player with the <code>W</code> flag.  Wizards have control over all
objects in the database, and may use restricted commands available only
to them. ('Wizard' is often shortened to `wiz'.)</p>

<p><dt>Realm Wizard or Realms Wizard: <dd>An administrator of a certain
area within a <code>MUCK.</code> Realms wizards have partial command
over objects and players within their area, but cannot use wiz commands.
Use of the realms wizard system is somewhat uncommon.</p>

<p><dt>Mortal: <dd>A non-wizard character. This term too is used less
frequently on <code>MUCKs</code> than on <code>MUSHes</code> and
<code>MUDs.</code> While wizards are technically players, people usually
refer simply to `wizzes' on the one hand and `players' on the other.
(Where the distinction is important, this manual will use the term
`mortal'.)</p>

<p><dt>Staff: <dd>A <code>MUCK</code> administrator, who may or may not
be a wizard, and may or may not have access to restricted commands. A
common staff position is `helpstaff': someone who agrees to help new
players and answer questions, but seldom has access to restricted
commands. Most wizards are staff, but occassionally a player will be
given a wizbit without staff responsibilities and privileges. In other
words, `staff' is an administrative rather than technical term.</p>

<p><dt><code>MPI:</code> <dd>An online programming language with a
<code>LISP</code>-like syntax. <code>MPI</code> is available to all
players. Because it is universally available, <code>MPI</code> includes
a number of security features that restrict its power. <code>MPI</code>
is covered in <a href="mpi.html">Section 3.</a></p>

<p><dt><code>MUF:</code> <dd>An online programming language with a
<code>FORTH</code>-like syntax. <code>MUF</code> security is handled
through a system of privileges. In order to program in <code>MUF,</code>
one must have a `Mucker bit' (an <code>M</code> flag). Mucker bits range
from <code>M1</code> (highly restricted) to <code>M3</code> (almost as
powerful as a <code>Wizard</code> flag).  On well established
<code>MUCKS,</code> only highly trusted players with demonstrated
programming skill are given <code>M3</code> bits. The power and
efficiency of <code>MUF</code> make <code>MUCK</code> readily
user-extensible. <code>MUF</code> is covered in <a
href="muf.html">Section 3.</a></p>
 
<p><dt>User-Created Command or User-Created Program: <dd>These terms are
not commonly used on <code>MUCKs,</code> but are often used in this
manual, and so are mentioned here. Many of the commands people are
accustomed to using on <code>MUCKs</code> are not part of the
<code>MUCK</code> server, but rather separate programs created by
players and wizards. Soft-coded commands, in other words.  Some (such as
the <code>say,</code> <code>page,</code> and <code>whisper</code>
commands used on most <code>MUCKs</code> ) are enhancements of server
commands. Others (such as <code>ride,</code> <code>lsedit,</code> and
<code>lookat</code>) are basic utilities that do something the server
itself cannot. A large <code>MUCK</code> will also have a great many
other user-created commands and programs: some invaluable, some highly
specialized, and some frivolous.</p>

<p><dt>Control: <dd>This term too is used quite frequently in the manual. In 
almost all cases, your permission to change an object is determined by 
whether or not you control it. For mortals, control is essentially 
synonymous with ownership: you control everything you own; you don't 
control things you don't own, with one exception: anyone can control 
an unlinked exit. Wizards and realms wizards have extended control: 
Realms wizards control anything in their realm, including players; 
wizards control everything.</p>

<b><p>Frequently used abbreviations:</p></b>

<dl>
<p><dt><code>VR:</code> <dd>Virtual Reality. The <code>MUCK</code> world or
worlds. Characters live there.</p>

<p><dt><code>RL:</code> <dd>Real Life. The world outside the
<code>MUCK.</code> Most players live there.</p>

<p><dt><code>M*</code> or <code>M***:</code> <dd>A generic abbreviation
for all flavors of text-based, Internet-accessible, interactive
programs, including <code>MUD,</code> <code>MUSH,</code>
<code>MUX,</code> <code>MOO,</code> <code>MUSE,</code> and
<code>MUCK</code>.</p>

<p><dt><code>IC:</code> <dd>In Character. Acting or speaking as your
character, rather than as you, the player.</p>

<p><dt><code>OOC:</code> <dd>Out of Character. Acting or speaking as
you, the player, rather than the character. Medieval warriors arguing
about Mac vs. Windows are <code>OOC.</code> In some situations, on some
<code>MUCKs,</code> being <code>OOC</code> without signalling that you
are doing so (by putting something like <code>`(OOC)'</code> or
<code>`notes OOC'</code> before your poses and comments) is considered a
breach of etiquette.</p>

<p><dt><code>IMHO:</code> <dd>In My Humble (or Holy) Opinion, &
<code>IMO,</code> In My Opinion</p>

<p><dt><code>LOL:</code> <dd>Laughs Out Loud</p>

<p><dt><code>AFK:</code> <dd>Away From Keyboard</p>

<p><dt><code>BRB:</code> <dd>Be Right Back</p>

<p><dt><code>BBL:</code> <dd>Be Back Later</p>

<p><dt><code>TS:</code> <dd>TinySex. To make love or have sex on the
<code>MUCK,</code> via the gestures and comments of your character.
<code>TS</code> is both a verb and noun.</p>

<p><dt><code>TP:</code> <dd>TinyPlot. A role-played, jointly-authored,
predominantly improvised storyline acted out by a group of players.
<code>TPs</code> are usually consensual: players agree ahead of time to
participate in the <code>TP,</code> though other players may be drawn
into the <code>TP</code> by the storyline's development. Usually players
will plan the main conflict, premise, or events ahead of time &#151; at
least provisionally &#151; and improvise their characters' individual
contributions and reactions. (The terms 'TinySex' and `TinyPlot' derive
from `TinyMUD', an early server from which <code>MUCK</code> grew out
of.)</p>

<p><dt><code>RP:</code> <dd>Role Playing. Acting <code>IC</code> in a
way that is consistent with either the overall theme of the
<code>MUCK,</code> a TinyPlot in which one is participating, or both.
Some <code>MUCKs</code> are predominantly places to <code>RP;</code>
some are mostly places to socialize, where <code>RP</code> is
sporadic.</p> </dl>

<p>Sidebar: <code>MUCK</code> itelf is not an abbreviation or acronym.
The names of other <code>M*</code> servers are: <code>MUD</code> stands
for Multi-User Dungeon or Multi-User Domain; <code>MUSH</code> for
Multi-User Shared Hallucination; <code>MOO</code> for <code>MUD,</code>
Object Oriented. <code>MUCK</code> is simply a name with a sound and
connotations rather like those of <code>MUD</code> and
<code>MUSH.</code> Purportedly, the name derives from the fact that
<code>MUF</code> gives players the ability to `muck around with' the
database.</p>
