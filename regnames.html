<p><b>2.1.5  Registered Names</b></p>

<p>Objects can be specified by `registered names' as well as by names
and dbrefs. A registered name is an alias that can (like a dbref) be
used regardless of the object's location, but (like a name) consisting
of a memorable string. The primary use is to provide a convenient,
memorable way of specifying an item, regardless of its location and
ownership. For example, a player on a large <code>MUCK</code> might have
a puppet with a long, difficult to remember dbref, such as
<code>#128629.</code> If the player frequently wanted to teleport the
puppet to her from somewhere else, she would need to either memorize the
dbref or repeatedly retrieve it with the <code>@find</code> command. As
an alternative, she could give the puppet an easy-to-remember registered
name such as `pup'.  From that point on, the puppet could be specified
with the name `pup' preceeded by a <code>$</code> dollar sign, rather
than by dbref.</p>

<p>Players can create registered names &#151; usuable only by the player
&#151; with the <code>@register</code> command, syntax <code>@reg #me
&lt;object&gt; = &lt;registered name&gt;</code>. (The information is
stored in the player's <code>_reg/</code> directory.)</p>

<p><code>
====================================<br>
&gt; @find Squiggy<br>
&nbsp;  Squiggy(#128629XZ)<br>
&nbsp;  ***End of List***<br>
&nbsp;  1 objects found.<br>
&gt; @reg #me #128629 = pup<br>
&nbsp;  Now registered as _reg/pup: Squiggy(#128629XZ) on Jessy(#2PWQX)<br>
&gt; @tel $pup = me<br>
&nbsp;  Teleported.<br>
&gt; i<br>
&nbsp;  You are carrying:<br>
&nbsp;  Squiggy(#128629XZ)<br>
&nbsp;  You have 5086 pennies.<br>
===================================<br>
</code></p>

<p>Individual registered names may also be set when an object is
created. The standard creation commands &#151; <code>@create, @dig,
@action</code>, and <code>@open</code> &#151; each take two optional
argument fields, separated by = equals signs. The first of these fields
is specific to each command; the second field for all four may be used
to specify a registered name. </p>

<p><pre>
     @create &lt;name&gt; = &lt;cost in pennies&gt; = &lt;reg name&gt;
     @dig &lt;name&gt;    = &lt;parent room&gt;     = &lt;reg name&gt;
     @action &lt;name&gt; = &lt;source&gt;          = &lt;reg name&gt;
     @open &lt;name&gt;   = &lt;link&gt;            = &lt;reg name&gt;
</pre></p>

====================================<br>
</code></p>
     
<p>Wizards can set global registered names &#151; usuable by all players &#151;
syntax <code>@reg &lt;object&gt; = &lt;registered name&gt;</code>. A
frequent and convenient use of global registered names is to provide an
alias for publicly available programs such as `do-nothing' and
`obvious-exits'.  Without global registered names, players would need to
find the dbrefs of these programs each time they needed them for
building purposes.  Since the players do not control these programs,
finding the dbrefs can be difficult. (To create a personal registered
name as a wizard, use the <code>#me></code> option: <code>@reg #me
&lt;object&gt; = &lt;registered name&gt;)</p>

<p><code>

&gt; @find obv<br>
