<p><b>5.2.2  Recruiting a Staff</b></p>

<p>Recruiting and keeping a good staff of wizards can be surprisingly
difficult. The best wizards already <em>are</em> wizards somewhere, and
have little incentive to take on another world and stick with it through
the long haul.</p>

<p>Putting and keeping a <code>MUCK</code> online requires the sustained
efforts of several people. At least one person on the staff should have
solid technical skills, and all staff members should have a thorough
understanding of the difference between a <code>#dbref</code> and a hole
in the ground. But it is not necessary nor even advisable to recruit
wizzes exclusively from a pool of technical hot-shots. Technical
expertise is one (and only one) of several skills required among staff
members.  Interpersonal, organizational, and writing skills are
important as well.  A strong staff will have a balance of these skills
among them, plus time, energy, and commitment.</p>

<p>Time, energy, and commitment are in fact the most scarce and valuable
of <code>VR</code> resources. And, wizards who become inactive after a
first flush of enthusiasm are the most common management problem. There
are no magic bullets for these problems, just hard-to-follow advice:</p>

<ul>
   <li> <p>Try first to find the ideal candidates for wiz positions.
     There are two flavors:

     <ul>
			 <li> Good, active wizards who would like to move on from a world
			 where there is friction among staff, or their area of
			 responsibility is limited.

			 <li> Good, energetic players who demonstrate maturity and skill
			 in one of the areas a new <code>MUCK</code> needs. Helpstaffers
			 on large <code>MUCKs</code> are a good pool: these are people
			 with a demonstrated willingness to spend their online time making
			 things work.</p>
     </ul>

   <li> <p>Recruit friends if you want, but don't do so on the basis of
     friendship. Recruit friends who have something to offer, and
     know from the outset that one day you may need to ask your
     friend to resign, or be stuck with an inactive wizard.</p>

   <li> <p>Be willing to perform the unpleasant task of firing wizards
     who don't work out.</p>
</ul>
