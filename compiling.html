<p><b>5.1.2  Compiling a MUCK</b></p>

<p><code>UNIX</code> gurus and C buffs should have little difficulty
compiling a <code>MUCK.</code> For the rest of us, it is a potentially
frustrating experience. This section of the manual is addressed to the
rest of us: sysadmins and C developers, you can use this time to go
toggle in a new kernal from the front panel of a <code>PDP-11,</code>
just to keep your hand in.</p>

<p><code>MUCK</code> is not a shrink-wrapped, plug-and-play product. It
is, rather, a large  freeware application developed over a number of
years by skilled coders who are willing to devote innumerable hours to
making something for other people to use and enjoy. It is assumed that
you &#151; the site administrator &#151; have reasonable facility with
the <code>UNIX</code> operating system and a basic understanding of how
to configure the program by editing C source code configuration and
header files. In other words, like <code>UNIX</code> itself,
<code>MUCK</code> is quite user-friendly, but rather choosy about who
its friends are. The following overview may help you get on speaking
terms with your new server.</p>

<p>It is of course madness to try to set up a <code>MUCK</code> without
knowing <code>UNIX.</code>  Nonetheless, people often try, and often
succeed. A good book on <code>UNIX</code> will be a worthwhile
investment if you are going to be the <code>MUCK's</code> site
administrator.</p>

<p>If the set up goes smoothly &#151; that is, if your system has
everything where <code>MUCK</code> expects it to be &#151; this
information should be all you need.  If you encounter compilation
errors, you'll need to enlist help. Those sysadmins and C developers
will be through toggling in their microkernals by the time you've gotten
that far, and will no doubt be <code>MUCK</code>'ing somewhere. Go to a
large <code>MUCK,</code> and try a public shout, or paging helpstaffers
and wizards, asking if someone can lend a hand compiling a
<code>MUCK.</code></p>

<p>Getting your server up and running involves the following steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Getting a compressed, archived file containing the source code.
  <li>Uncompressing the files.
  <li>Editing configuration files
  <li>Compiling the source code
  <li>Specifying database files
  <li>Starting and logging onto the server
</ol>

<p><em>Getting the Server</em>:</p>

<p>The <code>MUCK</code> platform has evolved over a number of years,
from TinyMUD, written by James Aspnes, to its current incarnation:
TinyMUCK, FuzzBall version 6.0, developed primarily by Garth Minette.
The most current and authoritative version should be available at
ftp.belfry.com/pub. You may want to get the archive of standard
<code>MUF</code> programs and a start-up database as well.</p>

<p><code>
<ol>
    <li>pub/fuzzball/fb6.0.tar.gz
    <li>pub/fuzzball/fbmuf.tar.gz
    <li>pub/fuzzball/basedb.tar.gz
</ol>
</code></p>

<p>Put the <code>fb6.0</code> file where you want the top level of your
<code>MUCK</code> directory to go, perhaps in your home directory.</p>


<p><em>Uncompressing the Files</em>:</p>

<p>The files you just got are compressed archives of a great many files
and directories.</p>

<p>To uncompress them, type <code>gunzip &lt;filename&gt;.</code> For
example</p>

<p><code>
====================================<br>
 &nbsp;   gunzip fb6.0.tar.gz<br>
====================================
</code></p>

<p>If you get something like <code>gunzip: command not found,</code> try
<code>unzip:</code></p>

<p><code>
====================================<br>
 &nbsp;   unzip fb6.0.tar.gz<br>
====================================
</code></p>

<p>This uncompresses the archive. You now need to extract individual
files from the archive with the <code>tar</code> command
(<code>`tar'</code> for <code>`tape archive'</code>).</p>

<p><code>
====================================<br>
 &nbsp;   tar -xvf fb6.0.tar<br>
====================================
</code></p>

<p>The switches <code>-xvf</code> tell the system that you want to
eXtract files from an existing archive File, and that you'd like it to
do so Verbosely, so you can see what it's doing.</p>

<p>Type <code>ls</code> to `list files' in your current directory. You
should see, among other things, an entry for <code>fb6.0/</code> (the
<code>/</code> slash may or may not appear). This is the directory
holding the server.</p>

<p>If you got the dbase and <code>MUF</code> files, move them to the
correct spots in the server directories...</p>

<p><code>
====================================<br>
 &nbsp;   mv fbmuf.tar.gz fb6.0/game/muf<br>
 &nbsp;   mv basedb.tar.gz fb6.0/game/data<br>
====================================
</code></p>

<p>... and change directories (<code>cd</code>) down to the directories
holding the files and unpack them in the same fashion.</p>


<p><em>Editing the Configuration Files</em></p>

<p>In directory <code>fb6.0,</code> you should see a file called <code>INSTALLATION.</code> It gives succinct instructions for setting up the <code>MUCK.</code> Type <code>cat INST*</code> to list it on your screen.</p>

<p>You will be editing a few files (<code>include/config.h,</code>
<code>game/restart,</code> and possibly <code>include/params.h</code> or
<code>include/autoconf.h).</code> It is strongly recommended that you
make a copy of these files before you start modifying them, so you can
start over if something obscure goes wrong.  In the appropriate
directories...</p>

<p><code>
====================================<br>
 &nbsp;  cp config.h config.bak<br>
 &nbsp;  cp params.h params.bak<br>
 &nbsp;  cp autoconf.h autoconf.bak<br>
 &nbsp;  cp restart restart.bak<br>
====================================
</code></p>

<p>You can either edit the files directly on the server, with text
editors such as <code>vi</code> or <code>pico,</code> or you can
download the files to your computer, make changes, and then upload them.
Hereafter, the Manaul will simply instruct you to `edit' the files; do
so in whatever way works best for you.</p>

<p>Much of what you'll be doing when editing these files consists of
`defining' or `undefining' terms. A term is defined by beginning a line
with the <code>#define</code> preprocessor directive, followed by the
term and (optionally) its definition.</p>

<p>If a term is defined without a definition, such as...</p>

<p><code>
====================================<br>
 &nbsp;   #define GOD_PRIV<br>
====================================
</code></p>

<p>... this simply means that the term is `true': the compiler can in
effect check `Are we using God privileges?', and get a yes/no answer. In
this case, the term is defined; it has a true value: so, yes, we're
using God privileges.</p>

<p>If a definition is supplied, then the term is true, and has a
specific value. For example, </p>

<p><code>
====================================<br>
 &nbsp;   #define TINYPORT 8000<br>
====================================
</code></p>

<p>This means that, yes, we do have a specified default port to connect to:
port 8000.</p>

<p>You can `undefine' a term in either of two ways: you can comment it
out, or you can explicitly undefine it. To undefine a term, use the
<code>#undef</code> preprocessor directive:</p>

<p><code>
====================================<br>
    #undef ANONYMITY<br>
====================================
</code></p>

<p>To comment out a term (that is, to change it into a comment that
people can read, but to be ignored by the compiler), enclose it in the
strings <code>`/*'</code> and <code>`*/'</code></p>

<p><code>
====================================<br>
    /* #define DISKBASE */<br>
====================================
</code></p>

<p>In general, you should <code>#undefine</code> terms rather than
commenting them out: doing so will undefine the term, even if it was
defined somewhere else.</p>

<p>You won't need to change a very much.</p>

<p><p>In <code>include/config.h:</code></p>

<p>Edit the file to the port you want to use.</p>

<p><code>
====================================<br>
 &nbsp;  #define TINYPORT 8000<br>
====================================
</code></p>

<p>Port numbers below 1024 are reserved for system processes; use
something higher than 1024, and lower than 65,534.</p>

<p>It's recommended that you leave all other settings the same, until
you're familiar with each of them and have a specific reason for
changing them.</p>

<p>You shouldn't need to change anything in
<code>include/params.h.</code></p>

<p>In <code>game/restart:</code></p>

<p>This file is a shell script, a set of commands that execute
conditionally, rather like a <code>DOS</code> batch file. In addition to
starting and restarting the <code>MUCK,</code> it does some logging and
error checking: it bails out if the <code>MUCK</code> is already
running, so you won't have duplicate processes running, keeps a log of
when the <code>MUCK</code> was restarted, and warns of conditions such
as missing or damaged database files, or insufficient memory. You will
need to make a couple changes to this file.</p>

<p>Near the top of the file, change the line which sets the variable
holding the path name for the <code>MUCK.</code> If you left the name of
the directory created when you un-tar'd the server as
<code>fb6.0,</code> and didn't rename any sub-directories in the server
directory, you would set the path variable as follows:</p>

<p><code>
====================================<br>
 &nbsp;   set GAMEDIR = $HOME/fb6.0/game<br>
====================================
</code></p>

<p>The port number needs to be specified in restart as well:</p>

<p><code>
====================================<br>
 &nbsp;   set PORT = 8000<br>
====================================
</code></p>

<p>The server process is called <code>`netmuck'</code> (the executable
file that actually runs the server is <code>`netmuck'</code>).
<code>`Restart'</code> includes necessary references to
<code>`netmuck'.</code> On sites that have several <code>M*'s</code>
running, it's polite to rename <code>`netmuck'</code> to something else,
or to call it by an alias, so that the sysadmin can tell at a glance
what's what. If you're running the <code>MUCK</code> on your own
machine, and know you'll only have one <code>MUCK,</code> the following
step can be omitted.</p>

<p>Find the line that says...</p>

<p><code>
====================================<br>
 &nbsp;   You probably won't need to edit anything after this line.<br>
====================================
</code></p>

<p>... so you'll know where to start making changes. A few lines into
forbidden territory, you'll see the following line:</p>

<p><code>
====================================<br>
 &nbsp;   set muck = `ps -aux | grep netmuck | wc -l`<br>
====================================
</code></p>

<p>Replace the word <code>`netmuck'</code> with something indentifiable
as your <code>MUCK.</code> If your <code>MUCK</code> is called
<code>`Vanity Fair',</code> you might change it to:</p>

<p><code>
====================================<br>
 &nbsp;   set muck = `ps -aux | grep VanFair | wc -l`<br>
====================================
</code></p>

<p>And, the second to last line of the file:</p>

<p><code>
====================================<br>
 &nbsp;   ./netmuck $DBIN $DBOUT $PORT &gt;& logs/stdouterr.log &<br>
====================================
</code></p>

<p>Change <code>`netmuck'</code> here too.</p>

<p><code>
====================================<br>
 &nbsp;   ./VanFair $DBIN $DBOUT $PORT &gt;& logs/stdouterr.log &<br>
====================================
</code></p>


<p><em>Compiling the Source Code</em>:</p>

<p>Now it's time to compile the server. </p>

<p>A very brief rundown on what's happening here: In addition to
information files like <code>README</code> and
<code>INSTALLATION,</code> and the server you just downloaded consists
of quite a few files of `source code'...  human-readable text files
written in the C programming language. You'll use the `make' and
`configure' utilities to create machine-executable code from the source
files.</p>

<p>Change directories to <code>game/src,</code> the directory holding
the source code.  Type <code>`configure'.</code> This determines what
flavor of <code>UNIX</code> you're running under, the location of
certain files and executables, and so forth. This part should be quite
straightforward. If it's not &#151; if you get messages such as
<code>`No processor installed'</code> or <code>`Welcome to
Macintosh'</code> &#151; log onto a large <code>MUCK</code> and find
someone who can help.</p>

<p>Now, the (first) moment of truth: while still in
<code>game/src,</code> type <code>`make'.</code>  Watch arcane messages
scroll by. Then, when they seem to have all done so, type <code>`make
install'.</code> Watch more arcane messages. You may see some labled
<code>`Warning'.</code> As long as the warning isn't followed by a
<code>`Fatal error',</code> you should be OK. (Fatal errors are
bad.)</p>

<p>If you get other compilation errors at this point, you'll need to
track down a guru to help you out. Again, wizzes, helpstaff, and
<code>@shouts</code> on large <code>MUCK's</code> are a good place to
start looking for one.</p>

<p>Once you have the server compiled, you should tidy up a bit. In the
compilation process, a number of `object files' were created... Object
files are intermediate files created as the compiler generates the
executables. After compiliation, you don't need them any more; they just
take up disk space. In the game/src directory, type <code>`make
clean'</code> to get rid of them.</p>


<p><em>Specifying Database Files</em>:</p>

<p>You need to provide the server with a database to use at start up.
You can use either the minimal database included with the server, or the
standard start-up database included in <code>basedb.tar.gz.</code> The
minimal database includes only two objects: Room <code>#0,</code> and
God, player <code>#1.</code> The start-up database includes about 70
objects, including important programs and a couple rooms.</p>

<p>The start-up database is of course more convenient, but you may wish
to use your own versions of the programs or to set aside some low dbrefs
for players and other important objects. If you use the start-up
database, the first objects you create will have dbrefs in the high
60's.</p>

<p>The minimal database is, well, minimal. You'll need to do a bit more
work to get the place going, but you'll have greater control.</p>

<p>The files to be used for the database are defined in the
<code>`restart'</code> script. We didn't change those: the server will
expect to find files <code>`std-db.db',</code>
<code>`std-db.old',</code> and <code>`std-db.new'.</code> The default
file names are fine, but we need to create the files themselves.</p>

<p>In directory <code>game/data...</code> If you're using the start-up
database</p>

<p><code>
====================================<br>
 &nbsp;   gunzip basedb.gz<br>
====================================
</code></p>

<p>This should create a file named <code>`basedb.db'.</code> Type
<code>ls</code> to make sure. If it created something else, use that
file name below:</p>

<p><code>
====================================<br>
    cp basedb.db std-db.db<br>
    cp basedb.db std-db.old<br>
    cp basedb.db std-db.new<br>
====================================
</code></p>

If you're using the minimal database:

<p><code>
====================================<br>
    cp minimal.db std-db.db<br>
    cp minimal.db std-db.old<br>
    cp minimal.db std-db.new<br>
====================================
</code></p>

These commands will make copies of the database file where the server
expects to find them.


<p><em>Starting and Logging onto the Server</em>:</p>

<p>You're now <em>almost</em> ready to start the <code>MUCK.</code> One
last thing... If you're on a public site, and edited the restart script
changing <code>`netmuck'</code> to something like
<code>`VanFair',</code> you need to either rename
<code>`netmuck',</code> or create an alias for it.</p>

<p>In the <code>`game'</code> direcectory, type <code>ls.</code> You
should see file <code>`netmuck'.</code>  Rename that file with the
following command:</p>

<p><code>
====================================<br>
 &nbsp;   mv netmuck VanFair<br>
====================================
</code></p>


<p>If you made a copy of the <code>restart</code> file, you may need to
make it executable at this point:</p>

<p><code>
====================================<br>
 &nbsp;   chmod +x netmuck<br>
====================================
</code></p>

<p>
<p>...in the final column.</p>

Now, type <code>`./restart'.</code> You should see some messages like
<code>`restarting at &lt;time&gt;'</code>.</p>

<p>Type <code>`ps -aux'.</code> This will list all the processes running
on the machine.  If all is right with your world, you should see a
process for it, a line with something like...</p>

<p><code>
====================================<br>
 &nbsp;   ./VanFair data/std-d<br>
====================================
</code></p>

<p>...in the final column.</p>

<p>If you see too much stuff, and can't tell if the server process is in
the list, filter it with the <code>grep</code>:</p>

<p><code>
====================================<br>
 &nbsp; ps -aux | grep VanFair<br>
====================================
</code></p>

<p><em>Quick and Dirty Trouble-Shooting</em>:</p>

<p>If the <code>MUCK</code> compiled correctly (you didn't get errors when
compiling, and you have a file named <code>`netmuck'</code> in your game
directory), but you don't have a process running, then something went
awry in the restart script. You should confer with your sysadmin or some
other knowledgable <code>UNIX</code>-type about it. Meanwhile, though, you
can use a simplified restart script. If the problem truly is in the restart
script, and not in the server, this should get you up and running while
you enlist outside help.</p>

<p>Move your current restart script to another file for safe
keeping:</p>

<p><code>
====================================<br>
 &nbsp;   mv restart restart.cp2<br>
====================================
</code></p>

Edit a new, simplified restart script, that includes the following three
lines:

<p><code>
====================================<br>
 &nbsp;   mv data/std-db.db  data/std-db.old<br>
 &nbsp;   mv data/std-db.new data/std-db.db<br>
 &nbsp;   ./VanFair data/std-db.db data/std-db.new 8000 &gt;& logs/stdouterr.log &<br>
====================================
</code></p>

<p>(<code>`VanFair'</code> and <code>`8000'</code> are specific to our
example: use the <code>MUCK</code> name and port number for your
<code>MUCK.</code>)

<p>Make the new script executable:</p>

<p><code>
====================================<br>
 &nbsp;   chmod +x restart<br>
====================================
</code></p>

<p>This script won't provide all the error checking and logging that the
full-blown one will, but there's also less to go wrong in it. With the
new script in place, type <code>`./restart'</code> again.</p>

<p>(A common reason for the restart script to fail: You are running your
<code>MUCK</code> on a server that is also hosting other <code>MUCK</code>s,
and neither you nor the other <code>MUCK</code> admins renamed
`<code>netmuck</code>'. Because the restart script uses this file name to see
if the server is already running when you try to restart, and bails out if so,
your restart script fails because it sees someone else's <code>MUCK</code>
running as a <code>netmuck</code> process. The fix: rename
<code>netmuck</code> and edit the restart script appropriately.)</p>

<p>We'll assume that you now have a <code>MUCK</code> process running.
Congratulations.</p>

<p>Now you need to log on. There is only one character on the
<code>MUCK...</code> <code>#1,</code> who is probably named `One'.
<code>#1's</code> initial password is `potrzebie'.  Connect to the
<code>MUCK</code> with your normal client, and log in:</p>

<p><code>
====================================<br>
 &nbsp;   connect #1 potrzebie<br>
====================================
</code></p>

<p>If you're running the minimal database, type <code>@stats:</code>
savor this pristine and perfect universe.</p>

<p><code><center><font color="red">
   ***************************************<br>
   *** IMPORTANT: CHANGE #1's PASSWORD ***<br>
   ***************************************<br>
</font></center></code></p>

<p>It is imperative to change God's password from the default.</p>

<p><code>
====================================<br>
 &nbsp;   @password potrzebie = &lt;whatever&gt;<br>
====================================
</code></p>

<p>You're done!</p>
