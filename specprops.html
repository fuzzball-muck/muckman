<p><b>2.1.1  Protected, Restricted, and Wizard Props</b></p>

<p>Property handling is governed by a system of privileges, though in
most cases this will be transparent to the user: you will usually be
able to set the properties you want without even being aware that the
server is checking to see if you're allowed to do so. Besides `normal'
props, there are three classes of priviledged properties: protected,
restricted, and wizard. The class of a property or propdir is determined
by the first character in its name. A prop or propdir beginning with an
<code>_</code> underscore, <code>%</code> percent sign, or
<code>.</code> period is `protected'. A prop or propdir beginning with a
<code>~</code> tilde is `restricted'. A prop or propdir beginning with
an <code>@</code> at-mark is `wizard'. If the prop or propdir begins
with any other character, it is `normal' or `unprotected'. (Note: the
`first character' restriction applies to any property or propdir. So,
<code>@email, @/email</code>, and <code>data/personal/@email</code> are
all wizard props: each includes a prop or propdir that begins with an
<code>@</code> at-mark.)</p>

<p>Properties beginning with a an <code>_</code> underscore can only be
written to by the owner of the object on which the property is stored,
or by programs owned by the owner, or by programs running at
<code>M3</code> or <code>W</code>.</p>

<p>Properties beginning with a <code>.</code> period can only be written
to <em>or read</em> by the owner of the object on which the property is
stored, or by programs owned by the owner, or by programs running at
<code>M3</code> or <code>W</code>.</p>

<p>Properties beginning with a <code>%</code> percent sign, like _
underscore properties, can only be written to by the owner or by
programs owned by the owner. The <code>%</code> percent sign properties
have the additional function of over-riding pronoun and name
substitutions. For example, if Jessy does <code>@set me = %n:the
Scamper Gal</code>, the prop will be protected, and will serve the
additional function of causing <code>`the Scamper Gal'</code> instead of
<code>`Jessy'</code> to be substituted in messages that use the
<code>`%n'</code> substitution string.  (See <a
href="pronounsubs.html">Section 2.1.7</a> for additional information on
substitution strings.)</p>

<p>A restricted property ( <code>~</code> ) may be read like an
unprotected prop, however it may only be modified by a wizard or a
wizbitted program. A common use of restricted props is appointing
non-wiz staff members.  Staff commands, exits to administrative areas,
and so forth, can be locked so that they may only be used by characters
with specific restricted prop, such as <code>`~staff'</code>.</p>

<p>A wizard property ( <code>@</code> ) may only be read or modified by
a wizard or a wizbitted program. The server records connection data in
players' propdir <code>@/.</code> On some <code>MUCKs,</code> wizard
props and propdirs are used to record administrative information such as
players' email addresses. Some wizbitted programs record potentially
sensitive data such as mail in a wizard propdir stored on players.</p>

<p>Locks can read any property&#151;including restricted and wizard
properties&#151;but may only check for matches with a specific value.
