<p><b>2.4  User-Created Commands</b></p>

<p>We have used the term `user-created commands' throughout the manual
to indicate `add-on' commands created by the wizards or players of a
<code>MUCK.</code> Most other issues affecting such commands &#151; the
command search path, exit priorities, locks, etc. &#151; have been
discussed at various points above.</p>

<p>Because efficient and flexible commands can easily be added to a
<code>MUCK,</code> the platform is highly customizable. In general, this
is a Really Good Thing: <code>MUCKs</code> can be continually improved
and tailored to their population's needs, without hacking the server
code, which often results in bugs and invariably results in innumerable
versions and patch levels of the program.</p>

<p>On the downside, you can't assume that something you've learned on
one <code>MUCK</code> will work exactly the same way on a different
<code>MUCK.</code> And, <code>The MUCK Manual</code> cannot provide a
complete reference for any given <code>MUCK.</code> </p>

<p>Most <code>MUCKs</code> do share a core set of standard programs,
libraries, and commands, distrubuted as the `standard database'.
Discussion of the standard commands is provided in <a
href="usercomref.html">Section 2.7</a>, User-Created Command Reference.
The programming libaries are discussed in <a
href="muflibref.html">Section 3.2.6</a>, <code>MUF</code> Library
Reference.</p>
