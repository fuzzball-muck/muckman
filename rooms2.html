<p><b>Overview: Rooms and the Environment Tree (cont'd)</b></p>

<p>The position of a room within the environment tree can be changed
(that is, it can be `re-parented') with the <code>@teleport</code>
command: teleport the daughter room to its new parent room. For example,
if another player wanted to begin a new area &#151; an African village
say &#151; she could start off from the pier in Sinshe, and use the
<code>@teleport</code> command to position the new rooms correctly.</p>

<p><code>
====================================<br>
&gt; @dig Environment: Afurica<br>
&nbsp;  Environment: Afurica created with room number #5266.<br>
&nbsp;  Parent set to Sinshe Parent Room(#635RA).<br>
&gt; @tel #5266 = #101<br>
&nbsp;  Parent set.<br>
&gt; @dig Kapiti Plain Environment Room<br>
&nbsp;  Kapiti Plain Environment Room created with room number #5435.<br>
&nbsp;  Parent set to Sinshe Parent Room(#635RA).<br>
&gt; @tel #5435 = #5266<br>
&nbsp;  Parent set.<br>
&gt; @dig Kapiti Plain -- By the Watering Hole<br>
&nbsp;  Kapiti Plain -- By the Watering Hole created with room <br>
&nbsp;  number #5433.<br>
&nbsp;  Parent set to Sinshe Parent Room(#635RA).<br>
&gt; @tel #5433 = #5435<br>
&nbsp;  Parent set.<br>
&gt; @act kap = me<br>
&nbsp;  Action created with number #5435 and attached.<br>
&gt; @link kap = #5433<br>
&gt; kap<br>
&nbsp;  Kapiti Plain -- By the Watering Hole(#5433R)<br>
&gt; @trace here<br>
&nbsp;  Kapiti Plain -- By the Watering Hole(#5433R)<br>
&nbsp;  Kapiti Plain Environment Room(#5435R)<br>
&nbsp;  Environment: Afurica(#5266R)<br>
&nbsp;  Master Environment(#101RA)<br>
&nbsp;  **Missing**<br>
&nbsp;  ***End of List***<br>
====================================<br>
</code></p>

<p>The new environment rooms do not have an <code>Abode</code> flag. In
order to make <code>#5435</code> and <code>#5266</code> appear for other
players in a <code>@trace,</code> and in order for player-created rooms
to be correctly parented, they will need to be set <code>Abode.</code>
Once Kenya has moved to <code>Kapiti Plain -- By the Watering
Hole(#5433)</code>, any new rooms she digs from there will be correctly
parented to <code>Kapiti Plain Environment Room(#5435)</code>.</p>

<p>Alternately, the parent room can be declared at the time the room is
created.</p>

<p><code>
====================================<br>
&gt; @dig Environment: Afurica = #101<br>
&nbsp;  Environment: Afurica created with room number #5266.<br>
&nbsp;  Trying to set parent...<br>
&nbsp;  Parent set to Master Environment(#101RA).<br>  
====================================
</code></p>

<p>Registered names also can be declared when the room is created.</p>

<p><code>
====================================<br>
&gt; @dig Kapiti Plain -- By the Watering Hole = #5435 = kap<br> 
&nbsp;  Kapiti Plain -- By the Watering Hole created with room <br>
