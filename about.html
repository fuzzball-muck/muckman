<h2>About this Manual</h2>

<p><em>The MUCK Manual</em> comprises five sections. <em>Section 1</em>
is an introduction for new players, covering basic commands and setting
up your character. <em>Section 2</em> deals with server commands and the
commands included in the standard start-up database. <em>Section 3</em>
covers programming. Tutorials are presented in <em>Section 4</em>.
<em>Section 5</em> discusses technical and nontechnical issues of
administering a <code>MUCK.</code> New players should read <em>Section
1</em>; others may safely begin with later sections. </p>

<p>The <em>Overview</em> sections provide relatively thorough discussion
of relevant concepts, but are not comprehensive. The <em>Reference</em>
sections are comprehensive (or at least attempt to be), but are written
in a terse style that assumes the reader has some familiarity with the
topic or has read the <em>Overview</em>. The remaining sections discuss
aspects of the section topic meriting special attention.<p>

<code>
====================================<br>
Examples in the manual are set off by half-lines of equal signs,
like this.<br>
====================================<br>
</code>

<p>Text enclosed in [square brackets] is optional. Text enclosed in &lt;angle
brackets&gt; should be edited as appropriate for you and your character. For
example, where the manual says `type &lt;your name&gt;', type your name, rather
than typing this literally. Within examples, lines beginning with a &gt;
greater than sign indicate material you should enter at your keyboard; the
remaining lines are sample output from the <code>MUCK.</code> (In some longer
programming entries, the &gt; sign has been omitted so that you may cut and
paste text from the web page to a <code>MUCK</code>.)</p>

<p><em>The MUCK Manual</em> attempts to provide a single, relatively
comprehensive reference for <code>MUCK,</code> as Lydia Leong's <em>MUSH
Manual</em> does for <code>MUSH.</code> The organization of <em>The
MUCK Manual</em> is in part based on her manual, and any indebtedness is
gratefully acknowledged.</p>

<p><em>The MUCK Manual</em> was written in collaberation with Winged of
SPR and FurryMUCK, author of the online documentation for
<code>MUCK,</code> version 6.0. Authors and editors of reference
materials quoted include Foxen (foxen@belfry.com), Fre'ta
(stevenl@netcom.netcom.com), Ioldanach (mortoj@rpi.edu).</p>

<p>This version of the manual was written for <code>MUCK</code> version
<code>2.2 fb5.64.</code>  Version <code>fb6.0</code> is given partial
coverage. Note: this is this is the 'Fuzzball' branch of the
<code>MUCK</code> server family, which is itself a branch of the
<code>TinyMUD</code> branch of <code>M*</code> server families. In other
words, while <em>The MUCK Manual</em> discusses <code>MUCK</code> as
though there were a single standard version, this is not really the
case. You should type <code>@version</code> on your <code>MUCK</code> to
see what version you are on. If the version info includes the letters
'fb', you can be pretty sure that material presented in <em>The MUCK
Manual</em> relates to your sever.  (If you have expertise in alternate
flavors of <code>MUCK</code> and would like to help me get up to speed so
that I can expand the manual, then great, let's talk!)</p>

<p>The Manual may be freely copied, distributed, quoted, and archived.</p>
