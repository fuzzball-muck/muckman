<p><b>2.1.4  Triggering From Properties</b></p>

<p>In most cases, programs and server operations are triggered (i.e.
caused to run or execute) by typing a command. However, they can also be
triggered from a number of protected properties: all message props
(<code>_/de, _/sc</code>, etc.), plus <code>_connect, _oconnect,
_disconnect, _odisconnect, _arrive, _oarrive, _depart, _odepart</code>,
and <code>_listen</code>.</p>

<p>Performing any of the actions implied by these property names sends
information to the server and (if the property is set correctly) causes
messages to be displayed, an <code>MPI</code> string to be parsed, or a
program to run. For example, if you set a <code>_connect</code> prop on
your character to trigger a certain program, the program will run each
time you connect; if you put an <code>MPI</code> string in your
<code>_/de</code> prop, it will be parsed each time someone looks at
you. The server searches up the environment tree (see <a
href="rooms1.html">Section 2.2</a>) for triggering props. For example,
if <code>_connect</code> prop that triggers a program is set on your
character, the program will run each time you connect. If it's set on a
room, the program will run each time someone connects in that room. If
it's set on the global parent room (<code>#0</code>), the program will
run each time someone connects anywhere on the <code>MUCK.</code>

<p>The manner in which the props are set differs depending on which prop
it is (the <code>_/</code> directory is handled differently than the
others, such a <code>_connect</code> or <code>_listen</code>) and on
what the intended result is (messages are handled differently than MPI,
which is handled differently than program calls).</p>

<p>To cause a message to be displayed by a <code>_/</code> prop
(<code>_/de, _/sc</code>, etc), simply set the message as a string, with
<code>@set</code> or the specific server command. <code>@o-</code>
messages such as <code>@osucc, @ofail</code>, and <code>@odrop</code>
are prepended with the name of the triggering player (or other object
type).</p>

<p><code>
====================================<br>
&gt; @desc out=A simple wooden door.<br>
&nbsp;  Message set.<br>
&gt; look out<br>
&nbsp;  A simple wooden door.<br>
<br>
&gt; @succ out=You decide to go outside for a bit...<br>
&nbsp;  Message set.<br>
&gt; out<br>
&nbsp;  You decide to go outsides for a bit...<br>
<br>
&gt; @set out=_/sc:You head outside.<br>
&nbsp;  Property set.<br>
&gt; out<br>
&nbsp;  You head outside.<br>
====================================<br>
</code></p>

<p><code>MPI</code> strings in <code>_/</code> props will be parsed automatically.</p>

<p><code>
====================================<br>
&gt; @desc watch=You glance at your watch. The time is {time}.<br>
&nbsp;  look watch<br>
&nbsp;  You glance at your watch. The time is 01:44:31.<br>
====================================<br>
</code></p>

<p>To trigger a <code>MUF</code> program from a <code>_/</code> prop,
preceed the dbref of the program with an <code>@</code> at-mark. For
example, let's assume the dbref of the `Obvious Exits' program is
<code>#123</code>:</p>

<p><code>
====================================<br>
&gt; @succ here=@#123<br>
&nbsp;  Message set.<br>
&gt; look here<br>
&nbsp;  Messy Room(#545RJ)<br>
&nbsp;  Boy, this place is a mess!<br>
&nbsp;  Obvious Exits:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     Out &lt;O&gt;<br>
====================================<br>
</code></p>

<p>The other triggering props (<code>_arrive, _oconnect</code>, etc) are
handled slightly differently. Simple strings cause no result,
<code>MPI</code> must be preceeded with an <code>&</code> ampersand in
order to be parsed, and <code>MUF</code> programs can be called with
just a string indicating the dbref.</p>

<p><code>
====================================<br>
&gt; @set me=_connect:555<br>
&nbsp;  Property set.<br>      
&gt; @set me=_arrive:&{null:{otell:waltzes in.}}<br>
&nbsp;  Property set.<br>
====================================<br>
</code></p>

<p>These triggers can be set up as a propdir rather than a single prop,
in order to trigger multiple results from the same action. For example,
the following settings would trigger both programs <code>#581</code> and
<code>#555</code> each time someone connects in the room. The propdirs
are evaluated in alphabetical order, so <code>#581</code> would execute
first. (Other than determining alphabetical order, the prop names
following the first <code>/</code> slash mark have no effect: they can
be whatever you like.)</p>

<p><code>
====================================<br>
&gt; @set here=_connect/desc-check:#581<br>
&nbsp;  Property set.<br>
&gt; @set here=_connect/my-wwf:#555<br>
&nbsp;  Property set.<br>
====================================<br>
</code></p>

<p>The <code>_listen</code> is triggered by <em>any</em> activity. As
such, it is both very useful and very easily abused. Permissions
safeguards are coded into the server for <code>_listen:</code> the only
result that can be triggered is execution of a program; the program must
be set <code>Link_OK</code> and have a Mucker level equal to or higher
than a level set by the <code>MUCK</code> administrators. Usually this
parameter is set to <code>3</code> or <code>4</code> (<code>M4</code> is
`wizard'). `Bot programs and automatic `noise' or `event' programs are
common examples. The prop is set simply by putting the dbref of the
program to run in the property value.</p>

<p><code>
====================================<br>
&gt; @find noises<br>
&nbsp;  noises.muf(#812FLM3)<br>
&nbsp;  ***End of List***<br>
&nbsp;  1 objects found.<br>
&gt; @set here=_listen/noise:812<br>
&nbsp;  Property set.<br>   
====================================<br>
