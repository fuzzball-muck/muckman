<p><b>5.2.1  Conceptualizing the World</b></p>

<p>The historical bias of <code>MUCK</code> toward socializing presents
the would-be administrators of a new world with a special challenge. On
platforms such as <code>MUSH,</code> with its emphasis on role playing,
creating a successful new world is not intrinsically difficult: one
develops a well-written geography and sound command structure, plants
<code>TP</code> seeds with timelines and background events, advertises
the <code>MUSH,</code> and the world has a good chance to survive. If
it's well done, and if it taps into a new or popular genre, it should
attract players. But, <code>MUCKs</code> tend to be primarily places to
socialize rather than <code>RP.</code> There is no technical reason why
<code>MUCK</code> is not as good as or better than <code>MUSH</code> for
<code>RP,</code> but the trend is there. So long as players' motivation
for <code>MUCKing</code> is socializing, established worlds will have a
powerful advantage over new worlds in attracting players: if one goes to
<code>MUCKs</code> in order to meet and be with people, it makes good
sense to go to a world where there are 300 people online rather than a
struggling new place where there are three.  Unless the new world offers
something that established worlds do not, the administrators will, after
a great deal of time and effort, find themselves lords of a very lonely
domain.  </p>

<p>Dealing with this problem is beyond the scope of this manual, but it
is mentioned and even stressed here because it is very easy for new
administrators to lose sight of. Their new world seems grand to them
&#151; at least in part &#151; because now they are
<em>wizards</em>, now they are <em>in charge</em>. It's a grand new
world because, in short, it is their world.  But if players are to make
it their world as well, the administrators will need to give thought to
a fundamental question: Why should anyone come here?</p>

<p>Does the <code>MUCK</code> put a new genre online? Are there
intriguing adventures or quests, or well-wrought gaming programs? Does
it appeal to some audience beyond that of current <code>MUCKs?</code>
Are players brought together by a common and heretofore unserved
interest? The answer to at least one of these questions needs to be
`yes'.</p>
