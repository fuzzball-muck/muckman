<p><b>Dbrefs and Names:</b></p>

<p>A dbref is assigned to each object when it is created. In most cases,
when specifying an object by its dbref, the number should be preceded by
an <code>#</code> octothorpe. (Some user-created programs require that the
octothorpe be omitted when the dbref is stored in a property.) The
server assigns either the next available number or that of the most
recently recycled object. For example, if the database holds 1,000
objects and all are valid (have not been recycled), the next object
created will be given dbref <code>#1001.</code> If someone then recycles
an object, say <code>#123,</code> the next object created would be given
dbref <code>#123.</code> So, dbrefs are not a reliable guide to an
object's age. Dbrefs cannot be changed.  Unused dbrefs of recycled
objects are `garbage'.</p>

<p>Multiple objects can have the same name, except for players: there
can be several hundred exits named `out' on a <code>MUCK,</code> but
only one player named `Ruffin'... and there could (conceivably) be many
things, exits, and programs named `Ruffin'. All names can be changed
with the <code>@name</code> command, syntax <code>@name &lt;object&gt; =
&lt;new name&gt;</code>. To rename a player, the password must be
supplied as well: <code>@name &lt;'me' or old name&gt; = &lt;new
name&gt; &lt;password&gt;</code>. A player must have control of an
object to rename it; programs can rename objects if the object and the
program have the same controller, or if the program is set
<code>W.</code> (Programs can only name players indirectly: if the
player's password is available, a wizbitted program can force the player
or a wizard to rename a player.).</p>

<p>Player names cannot include spaces. <code>`Madame_Bovary'</code> is an
acceptable player name, but <code>`Madame Bovary</code>' is not. The names of
other types of objects can include spaces.</p>

<p>When handling or modifying an object in the same vacinity as you, you
can specify it by its name or part of its name. Partial names will work,
provided that you specify enough characters to distinguish the object
from others in the vacinity: <code>@desc super =
&lt;description&gt;</code> will describe `Superball', provided that
`Superman' or something else with a name beginning with `Super-' is not
in the same vacinity.</p>

<p>When handling or modifying an object that has the same name as
something else in the vacinity, or an object not in the same vacinity as
your character, the object will need to be specified by dbref. You can
determine the dbref of an object controlled by you and in the same
vacinity by examining it (</code>ex &lt;object&gt;</code>). You can
determine the dbref of objects that you control but are not in the same
vacinity with the <code>@find</code> command, syntax <code>@find &lt;object's
name&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>Two substitution strings can be used in place of either a name or
dbref: <code>`me'</code> and <code>`here'.</code> <code>`Me'</code>
matches your character's dbref; <code>`here'</code> matches the dbref of
the room you are in.</p>

  You can't give a player that name. <font color="red">(* Already a player named Ruffin. *)</font>
> @name me = Nebuchudnezer flipFlap
  Name set. <font color="red">(* But Nebuchudnezer works. *)</font>
