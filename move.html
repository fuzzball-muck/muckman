<p><b>1.4.2  Moving</b></p>

<p>The <code>go</code> or <code>goto</code> command causes your
character to move in a certain direction or use a specific exit. For
example, typing <code>goto north</code> would cause your character to
move one room to the north (assuming there is a room to the north &#151;
or, more accurately, there is an exit named `north' in your current
location, leading to another room). The <code>goto</code> command is not
really necessary, and is almost never used: typing the exit name by
itself will also cause you to `go' in that direction, and directions are
usually abbreviated to their first letter. Thus, typing
<code>north</code> or <code>n</code> should produce the same result as
<code>goto north</code>. If you can't go in a particular direction
(because there is no exit in that direction, or the exit is locked
against you), you will see a fail message such as `You can't go that
way.'. A commonly used exit name is `out' or `o': typing either of these
in an interior room will often move you outside the room or building.
</p>

<p>Frequently, the builder of a room makes use of a program that appends
the names of `Obvious Exits' to the description of a room (An `obvious'
exit is one that is not hidden by being set <code>Dark</code>). The
names of these exits will then appear in a list below the room's
description. The absence of such a list does not mean that there is no
way out of the room. Read the room's description carefully to see if it
indicates directions you can go. If you are still unable to determine
valid directions, try common-sense directions such as `west', `n', or
`out'.  If all else fails, you can get out of room by typing `home' or
`gohome', which will return you to your home location.</p>
