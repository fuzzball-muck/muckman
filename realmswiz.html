<p><b>Setting Up the Database (cont't)</b>:</p>
<p><em>Using the Realms Wizard System</em>:</p>

<p>Realms Wizards are players who have extended control over objects within
a certain area of the MUCK... that is, in rooms parented to a common
environment room. There are advantages and disadvantages to the realms
wizards system, discussed below. Whether you are going to use the system
is not something you must decide immediately, but if you are going to
use realms wizards, there a few advantages to doing so from the
outset.</p>

<p>In order to use the realms wizards system, the system parameter
<code>realms_control</code> must be tuned to <code>`yes'.</code> The
effect is to give the owners of rooms set <code>Wizard</code> extended
control over objects in that room, and over objects in rooms parented to
that room. A realm wizard can examine, set properties on, and link
objects within his realm as though he owns them.  He cannot chown
objects belonging to others, unless the objects are set
<code>Chown_OK,</code> and he can only force objects that are set
<code>xForcible</code> and force locked to him, but &#151 since he can
<code>@force_lock</code> and set flags on objects in the realm &#151 he
can essentially chown and force anything in the realm as well. He can
<code>@teleport</code> anywhere within the realm, just as a wizard can.

<p>There are decided advantages to making your staff builders realms
wizards. The extended control is a genuine help as they construct the
area, and their realm wizard status may well be a motivating factor:
they are lord in their realms, but that will only be meaningful if
people use the areas, so they have good reason to make the areas as well
constructed and attractive as possible. Once the area is built, they
will be able to help players with matters such as linking homes. Also,
making staff builders realms wizards rather than wizards avoids the
problem of having several surplus wizards once the world is
constructed.</p>

<p>The one significant disadvantage &#151; or at least consideration
&#151; is security. Wizards have virtually unlimited control over the
database, but they also have built-in accountability: all wizard
commands are logged, regardless of whether <code>log_commands</code> is
tuned to `yes' or `no'.  Within their realms, realms wizards have
comparable control, but their commands are not automatically logged. A
clever and malicious realms wizard could set locks and flags on a true
wizard who enters his area, and use these to directly or indirectly
force the true wizard to do something destructive or harmful elsewhere.
If (im)properly handled, the properties could erase themselves once they
have done their job, leaving no evidence, and the logs would show the
true wizard as the guilty party. The only real safeguard is the same
safeguard provided against true wizards: accountability. If you want to
use the realms wizard system, turn on command logging.</p>

<p>The realms wizard system works best if you set up a consistent,
geographically structured environment tree. This is much easier if done
when the <code>MUCK</code> is new. The following schematic shows how a
science fiction <code>MUCK</code> might be set up to use realms wizards.
Rooms <code>`Starport Env. Room'</code> and <code>`Earth Env.
Room'</code> would be chowned to staff builders, and set
<code>Wizard.</code> These players who own these two rooms would then
have primary responsibility for and control over those two areas.
Additional areas could be parented to <code>IC Environment Room,</code>
and the two realms control rooms could also include environment rooms,
perhaps with other players holding realms wizard control over those
smaller areas. </p>
