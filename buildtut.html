<p><b>4.5  Creating Rooms and Areas</b></p>

<p>Quality <code>MUCK</code> building requires a blend of creativity and
technical savvy.  At a minimum, you should ensure that rooms in your areas are
literately desc'd, and that exits have the standard message props
(<code>@desc</code>, <code>@succ</code>, <code>@osucc</code>, and
<code>@odrop</code>).</p>

<p>The building commands are discussed elsewhere in the manual. What follows
is a narration of building a village inn, with cross-references to relevant
commands. The process should illustrate most of the issues a builder will
face. Only two rooms are discussed, but the same techniques could be used over
a much larger area.</p>
