<p><b>1.5.2  Setting your Sex and Species</b></p>

<p>Your sex does not have to be male or female, but it's recommended.
From time to time you'll encounter programs or commands that format
their output based on the user's sex (pronoun substitution is the most
common instance). No harm will be done if your sex is something other
than male or female, but the program output may look a bit strange.</p>

<p>To set your sex, type ...</p>

<p><code> &nbsp; &nbsp; @set me = sex : &lt;value&gt;</code></p>

<p>Your species can be anything appropriate to the <code>MUCK.</code> On
<code>MUCKs</code> where everyone is human, the species prop is often
used to indicate a profession or social position.</p>

<p>To set your species, type ...</p>

<p><code> &nbsp; &nbsp; @set me = species : &lt;value&gt;</code></p>

<p>Many <code>MUCKs</code> have a user-created command that shows the
sex and species of everyone in the room. The most common is
<code>WhoSpecies</code> or <code>ws</code>. Type <code>ws</code> to see
if it's available on your <code>MUCK.</code></p>
