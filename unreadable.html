<p><b>Good but Unreadable</b></p>

<p><code>MUF</code> has one fairly significant weakness: the more you
write your code `the <code>MUF</code> way' &#151; that is, with fast,
low-level stack-handling primitives &#151; the less readable it becomes.
Here's an example...</p>

<p><pre>
: SomeFunction   ( d1 s1 d2 s2 --  ) 
                                    
  4 pick 4 pick propdir? if
    3 pick "*/" smatch not if
      3 pick "/" strcat 3 put
    then
  else
    pop pop pop pop exit
  then
  dup "*/" smatch not if
    "/" strcat
  then
    
  3 pick 5 rotate 5 rotate 5 rotate 5 rotate
  dup 5 rotate 5 rotate 5 rotate 5 rotate
  
  4 pick 4 pick nextprop dup 4 put
  5 rotate 5 rotate 5 rotate 5 rotate
    
  begin
    4 pick 4 pick getprop if
      pop over
      7 pick 7 pick swap subst
      4 pick 4 pick 4 pick 4 pick
      4 rotate 4 rotate getprop setprop
      4 pick 4 pick nextprop dup not if
        break
      then
      dup 4 put 5 put
    else
      4 pick 4 pick dup "*/" smatch if
        dup strlen 1 - strcut pop
      then
      over over nextprop not if
        pop pop break
      then
      nextprop dup 4 put 5 put
    then
    pop over 7 pick 7 pick swap subst
  repeat
  pop pop pop pop pop pop pop pop
;
</pre></p>

<p>All clear on what this function does? Probably not... In fact, it
does do something specific and useful: it copies the contents of one
propdir to another, omitting subdirectories, without disturbing the
underlying stack or relying on variables. But, without some help from
comments, it would take some doing to figure this out.</p>
