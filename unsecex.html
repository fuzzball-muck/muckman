<p><b>2.3.2  Unsecured Exits</b></p>

<p>An exit that is not linked to anything and not thoroughly locked is
unsecure, in that its ownership transfers to anyone who uses the exit
and anyone can link it. This creates a minor security risk: someone
could take control of an exit attached to one of your rooms and make it
do something annoying or harmful. So, always secure exits. An exit can
be secured by locking it to a condition that always fails &#151; such as
<code>me&!me</code> &#151; or by linking it to something. All
established <code>MUCKs</code> provide a `do-nothing' program, a program
that produces no result, and thus serves as a convenient linking point
for exits. Usually such a program is given the registered name
<code>$nothing</code> or <code>$do-nothing</code>.</p>
