<p>Your <code>MUCK</code> should almost certainly have an Acceptable Use
Policy, an explicit statement of what constitutes acceptable
online activity for the <code>MUCK</code> and &#151; more importantly
&#151; what does not. The policy serves two purposes:</p>

<p><ul>
  <li>It provides an objective basis for resolving disputes.
	<li>It provides some measure of protection should players engage in
	illegal activities online.
</ul></p>

<p>Resolving online disuputes well requires judgment, maturity, and a
certain degree of empathy... none of which are really `objective'
factors. But the more you can found your judgment in objective,
verifiable factors, the less you will open yourself to charges of
playing favorites, or being a hothead, or letting yourself be swayed by
personalities. Any of these can contribute to an unhealthy online
environment, so do what you can to put objective factors into place. The
Acceptable Use Policy is a primary tool for this.</p>

<p>Copyright and privacy laws as they relate to the Internet are
complex and rapidly evolving fields. The authors of <em>The MUCK
Manual</em> make no claim to expertise in this area. That being said, a
general premise stands: if you have put in place a policy stating the
site's position on copyright, privacy, and related issues, and have put
in place mechanisms to make players aware of the policy and a way for
them to indicate their agreement to abide by the policy, it will be much
easier for you to show that responsibility for any illegal acivity that
occurs on your site rests with an offending individual rather than you,
the site administrator.</p>

<p>A sample Acceptable Use Policy, which may be freely ammended to fit
the needs of your <code>MUCK</code>, is provided in <a
href="appendb.html">Appendix B</a>. You may also wish to install <a
href="cmd-aup.html">cmd-aup</a>, a program that lets players indicate
explicit agreement with the <code>MUCK</code>'s Acceptable Use Policy,
and provides a way to lock exits such that only players who have done
so may use them.</p>
