<p><b>4.2  Making a Multi-Action</b></p>

<p>Over time, many players end up creating several handy little macro
commands that provide shortcuts for frequent tasks, or create rooms that
have a number of specific, local commands. Rather than creating a
separate action for each command (an approach that quickly leads to
dbase bloat and eats up your quota), you can combine a number of
commands in a single action. The basic technique is to give the action
an alias name for each command, store <code>MPI</code> strings in
properties with the same names as the aliases, and use the command name
typed by the user to determine which property should be executed.</p>

<p>The following example creates a multi-action that lets you determine the
dbref of something in the same room, enter or review a page of `to do'
notes, and remotely lock or unlock the door into your home. First,
create the action attached to your character, and lock it to a condition
that always fails. Since the action is attached to you, no one else
should be able to use it... Nonetheless, it would be a good idea to
secure the exit by linking it to something, such as a do-nothing
program.</p>

<p><code>
====================================<br>
&gt; @act ref;note;notes;lockhome;unlockhome = me<br>
 &nbsp; Action created with number 9456 and attached.<br>
&gt; @lock ref = me&!me<br>
 &nbsp; Locked.<br>
&gt; @link ref = $nothing<br>
&nbsp;  Linked to gen-nothing.muf(#363FLM2).<br>
====================================
</code></p>

<p>The lock will fail unless the user <em>is</em> and <em>is not
you</em>... it will always fail. Now, set the action's
<code>@fail</code> with an <code>MPI</code> string that will cause other
<code>MPI</code> strings stored in properties on the object to be
executed.</p>

<p><code>
====================================<br>
&gt; @fail ref = {exec:{&cmd}}<br>
 &nbsp; Message set.<br>
====================================
</code></p>

<p><code>{&cmd}</code> is a variable... it holds whatever command name
the user typed.  If you used the action by typing <code>`ref',</code>
then the string <code>`ref'</code> would be substituted for
<code>{&cmd}</code> when the <code>@fail</code> is parsed; if you used
the the action by typing <code>`notes',</code> then <code>`notes'</code>
would be substituted for <code>{&cmd}.</code></p>

<p><code>{exec}</code> evaluates the property following it, executing
any <code>MPI</code> contained in it, and returning any resulting
strings to the user. So, typing <code>`notes'</code> would cause the
<code>`notes'</code> property on the object to be evaluated:
<code>{&cmd}</code> would be replaced by <code>`notes',</code> and
<code>{exec}</code> would use this value to determine which property it
should evaluate.</p>

<p>Now, set a property for each alias, containing <code>MPI</code> that
performs a function. One of the simplest ways to do this, is to force
yourself to use a command. In order to do so, you need to be set
<code>X(forcible)</code> and <code>force_locked</code> to yourself.</p>

<p><code>
====================================<br>
&gt; @set me = X<br>
 &nbsp; Flag set.<br>
&gt; @flock me = me<br>
 &nbsp; Force lock set.<br>
  <br>
&gt; @set ref =ref:{ref:{&arg}}<br>
 &nbsp; Property set.<br>
&gt; @set note =note:{force:me,lsedit notes=notes}<br>
 &nbsp; Property set.<br>
&gt; @desc note ={list:notes}<br>
 &nbsp; Description set.<br>
&gt; @set notes =notes:{force:me,look notes}<br>
  &nbsp; Property set.<br>
&gt; @set lockhome =lockhome:{force:me,@lock #17212=me&!me}<br>
  &nbsp; Property set.<br>
&gt; @set unlockhome =unlockhome:{force:me,@unlock #17212}<br>
  &nbsp; Property set.<br>
====================================
</code></p>

<p>The one action can now be used to do several different things. Typing
<code>`ref here'</code> would show the dbref of the room you are in
<code>({&arg},</code> like <code>{&cmd},</code> a variable: it holds
whatever was typed following the command name. If you typed <code>`ref
here',</code> the <code>&arg</code> variable would hold the string
<code>`here'</code>). Typing <code>`note'</code> would force you to use
<code>lsedit</code> to edit your page of notes. Typing
<code>`notes'</code> would force you to look at the notes: the list
would be printed on your screen. Typing <code>`lockhome'</code> would
force you to lock the exit into your home, specifying it by dbref so
that it doesn't matter where on the <code>MUCK</code> you are located.
Typing <code>`unlockhome'</code> would unlock the exit in the same
way.</p>
 
<p>(Notice that several of the actions world by `forcing' you to do
something. This is an easy way to make little macro commands. However,
be aware that in order for it to work, you must be set 'Xforcible', and
you must be 'force_locked' to yourself. So, do the following as
well:</p>

<p><code>
====================================<br>
&gt; @set me=X<br>
 &nbsp; Flag set.<br>
&gt; @flock me=me<br>
 &nbsp; Locked.<br>
====================================<br>
</code>)</p>


<p>A single multi-action like this can be extended indefinitely, by adding
aliases and a corresponding prop. To add a `look at my watch and check
the time' function, you could rename the action and set a `watch'
property that uses simple <code>MPI.</code></p>

<p><code>
====================================<br>
&gt; @name ref = ref;note;notes;lockhome;unlockhome;watch<br>
  &nbsp; Name set.<br>
&gt; @set watch = watch:You glance at your watch. The time is
{time}.<br>
  &nbsp; Property set.<br>
  <br>
&gt; watch<br>
  &nbsp; You glance at your watch. The time is 14:18:46.<br>
====================================
</code></p>
