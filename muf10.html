<p><b>3.2  Overview: MUF (cont'd)</b></p>

<p><b>Loops:</b></p>

<p>A loop is a section of code that executes repeatedly, until a certain
condition is met. The programmer defines the condition. If no condition
is defined (or if the condition is one that will never be met), the loop
will continue to execute indefinitely. This is called an `infinite
loop'. The code for a loop begins with the primitive <code>BEGIN</code>
and ends with either <code>REPEAT</code> or <code>UNTIL.</code></p>

<p>A common way to define the exit condition of a loop is to use a
variable to store the number of times the loop is to execute. With each
repetition (or `iteration') of the loop, the variable is increased
(`incremented') or decreased (`decremented') by one. When the value
stored in the variable matches a predefined limit (often
<code>0</code>), the loop exits. The following version of tinker.muf
uses a loop controlled in this manner to do the `random number test'
from the previous version three times.</p>

            <br>

====================================
</code></p>

<p>At the very top of the program, we declared the local variable
<code>ourCounter</code>. In the first line in main, we stored the integer 3
in our variable <code>ourCounter</code>. The next line is
<code>BEGIN,</code> which starts the loop. The first thing
<code>MUF</code> does with each pass through the loop is check to see if
the value stored in <code>ourCounter</code> is 0. If it is, execution
<code>BREAKs</code> out of the loop, and does whatever comes next (which
in this case is to tell us "OK, we're done.")</p>

In the first iteration of the loop, the <code>IF</code> test will be false,
because we just put a <code>3</code> in <code>ourCounter</code>, not a
<code>0.</code> So the loop will continue, executing our random number test.
Then, at the bottom of the loop, we fetch the number out of
<code>ourCounter</code>, subtract <code>1</code> from it, and then store the
new number back in <code>ourCounter</code>. Then the loop
<code>REPEATs,</code> jumping back to the top of the loop. This time, the
value in <code>ourCounter</code> is <code>2</code>... still not
<code>0,</code> so the loop exectutes again.  The next time the loop repeats,
the value is <code>1</code>: the random number test has executed three times.
Then execution will jump back to the top of the loop and begin for a
<em>fourth</em> iteration. This time, however, the value stored in
<code>ourCounter</code> has reached <code>0.</code> The <code>IF</code> test
will be true, so the <code>BREAK</code> will be executed. The program jumps
out of the loop and does whatever comes after the <code>REPEAT</code> (tells
us we're done).</p>

Here we are using <code>IF</code> to see if it is time to break out of
the loop. <code>MUF</code> provides another conditional statement that
does the same thing in shortened form. <code>WHILE</code> tests the top
value on the stack for truth, just like <code>IF</code> does. When an
<code>IF</code> test is true, code between the <code>IF</code> and its
matching <code>THEN</code> is executed; otherwise, it skips to whatever
follows the <code>THEN.</code> When a <code>WHILE</code> test is true,
code between the <code>WHILE</code> and the next <code>REPEAT</code> or
<code>UNTIL</code> is executed; otherwise, it skips to whatever follows
the <code>REPEAT</code> or <code>UNTIL.</code> In other words, the loop
continues to execute <code>WHILE</code> the condition is true.</p>

<p>In the above version of tinker.muf, we used...</p>
    
<p><code>
 &nbsp; &nbsp;  ourCounter @ 0 = if<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;    break<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp;  then
</code></p>
    
<p>to exit the loop. We could accomplish the same thing with...</p>
    
<p><code>
&nbsp; &nbsp;    ourCounter @ while
</code></p>

<p>As long as <code>ourCounter</code> is not <code>0,</code> it will be
true, and the rest of the loop will execute. When it gets to
<code>0,</code> it becomes false, and the <code>WHILE</code> will cause
execution to break out of the loop.</p>

<p><code>UNTIL</code> also provides a way to exit from a loop. The
<code>UNTIL</code> marks the `bottom' of the loop, like a
<code>REPEAT,</code> but also serves as an exit-condition check like
<code>WHILE.</code> If the value on top of the stack is true when the
program gets to <code>UNTIL,</code> execution `falls through' the bottom
of the loop and continues from there. For example, the following loop
repeats until <code>RANDOM</code> generates an integer greater than 1.5
billion.</p>

<p><code>
====================================<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp;    begin<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;        random<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;        dup intostr me @ swap notify <br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;        1500000000 &gt;<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp;    until<br>
====================================
</code></p>

<p>With each iteration, the loop generates a random number, converts it
into a string and notifies the user, then tests to see if it's greater
than 1.5 billion. If so, the top value on the stack at
<code>UNTIL</code> will be true, and the program will exit the loop.
Otherwise, execution jumps back to <code>BEGIN,</code> and the loop
repeats.</p>
