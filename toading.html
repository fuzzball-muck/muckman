<p><b>5.2.6  Toading</b></p>

<p>The command for getting rid of players is <code>@toad</code>. The
syntax is:</p>

<p><code>
  &nbsp; @toad &lt;player1&gt; [ = &lt;player2&gt; ]
</code></p>

<p>This turns the Player object for <code>player1</code> into an object
of type Thing, and transfers ownership of all objects owned by
<code>player1</code> to <code>player2</code>. If <code>player2</code>
is not supplied, all objects owned by <code>player1</code> will be
<code>@chowned</code> to the wizard issuing the <code>@toad</code> command.</p>

<p>The Thing object will retain all properties that were set on the player.</p>

<p>Occassionally you will need to toad players: sometimes for particularly
grave violations of the AUP, more often because the player wants to
leave the world or has simply stopped showing up and you want to reclaim
unused dbase space.</p>

<p><em>Some considerations:</em></p>

<p>As discussed in <a href="security.html">Section 5.1.4, Security
Concerns </a>, Wizards should examine the properties of objects they
<code>@chown</code>. If you are <code>@toading</code> a large number
of players, or <code>@toading</code> a player with a large number of
objects, it's a very good idea to supply a non-wiz player for objects
to be <code>@chowned</code> to when <code>@toading</code> (perhaps an
<code>NPC</code> player object used just for this purpose). This is of
course espcially important if the player is being <code>@toaded</code>
as a disciplinary measure for security violations.</p>

<p>If you are <code>@toading</code> idle players to reclaim database
space, you will probably want to <code>@recycle</code> objects they
own as well. It is advisable to proceed cautiously here. The player
may have created rooms, actions, or things that are in public use.
So, examine objects as you proceed. It will be much easier to keep
track of which objects should be checked and potentially recycled if
&#151; again &#151; you use a dedicated <code>NPC</code> character
to <code>@chown</code> objects too when <code>@toading</code>.
If you are consistent about supplying this character as the second
argument to the <code>@toad</code> command, you can periodically review
objects owned by this player (<code>@owned &lt;player name&gt;</code>),
and <code>@recycle</code> private objects previously owned by
<code>@toaded</code> players.</p>

<p>Players often ask to be <code>@toaded</code> when something online
upsets them. And, such players often change their minds. And, such
players aren't likely to be in a receptive frame of mind if you grill
them about whether they <em>really</em> want to leave. So... You can
make your life and theirs easier if you institute a "silent grace
period" policy. When players ask to be <code>@toaded</code>, just say
"OK", and let them leave with a minimum of fuss. But, instead of
actually <code>@toading</code> them at that point, give them a
new password and new name, and move them to a holding area. This way,
if they change their minds, they can come back easily... all you will
need to do is rename and repassword the character object. And, you
can take care of the database-related details of <code>@toading</code>
at your leisure. Periodically, you can review characters in the holding
area, and do an actual <code>@toad</code> on those who have been
gone for an appreciable period.</p>

<p><em>Fixing a mistake:</em></p>

<p>It is not all that hard to accidently <code>@toad</code> someone. If
you do, you can recreate the character exactly as it was, except for one
thing: You'll have to give it a new password. Hopefully, you have access
to the player's email address (see <a href="records.html">Record Keeping</a>),
in which case, you can simply recreate the character and send email letting
the player know what happened and telling him or her the new password. If you don't
have their email address, recreate the character and wait for a grumpy Guest
to show up, demanding to know what happened to his or her character.</p>

<p>To recreate an accidentally slain character, copy all properties from the
slimy toad object to a temporary holding object (so that you can reapply
them to the new character), then recycle the slimy toad object and
immediately <code>@pcreate</code> a new character with the same name (so that the new
player will have the same dbref, which might be used in props and programs).
Then, copy the properties back from the holding object to the new character.</p>

<p>The <code>`cp'</code> and <code>`mv'</code> commands are the easiest way to
shift the properties around, but, be aware that they will not move wizard or
restricted properties unless the program is set <code>Wizard</code>...  And,
be aware that if you are using the `stock' version of <code>cmd-mv-cp</code>,
you should <em>not</em> leave it set <code>Wizard</code>: doing so creates a
significant security hole. Two options: You can temporarily set
<code>cmd-mv-cp</code> <code>Wizard</code>, make your changes, and then set
<code>cmd-mv-cp</code> <code>not-Wizard</code>, or... you can install a
modified version of <code>cmd-mv-cp</code> (available <a
href="cmd-mv-cp.html">here</a>) that can safely be left at a
<code>Wizard</code> setting.</p>
