<p><b>4.4  Making Vehicles</b></p>

<p><code>MUCK</code> has a rather limited set of server commands for
using vehicles: objects configured such that players may get inside
them, and see what happens outside the vehicle. Many <code>MUCKs</code>
also have more elaborate <code>MUF</code> programs for vehicles. But,
since these will vary widely from <code>MUCK</code> to
<code>MUCK,</code> only the server vehcile commands are discussed
here.</p>

<p>A vehicle is in many ways much like a puppet. Whereas a puppet is
created by setting the <nobr><code>Z(ombie)</code></nobr> flag on an
object of type <code>THING,</code> a vehicle is created by setting the
<nobr><code>V(ehicle)</code></nobr> flag on an object of type
<code>THING.</code> Puppets broadcast anything hearable in their
location to their owner; vehicles broadcast anything hearable in their
location to all players inside the vehicle. The preface string marking
puppet output is set with the <code>@pecho</code> commmand; the preface
string marking vehicle output is set with the <code>@oecho</code>
command. As with puppets, it is usually necessary to
<code>force_lock</code> the vehicle to users who are allowed to drive
(or fly or steer) it, and to create an action that implements this. One
significant difference between puppets and vehicles: you need to create
an action that lets you get inside a vehicle. This done by creating an
action that is both attached and linked to the vehicle:</p>

<p><code>
====================================<br>
&gt; @create 1967 Corvette Sting Ray<br>
 &nbsp; 1967 Corvette Sting Ray created with number #558.<br>
&gt; @set 1967 = V<br>
 &nbsp; Flag set.<br>
&gt; @act getin = 1967<br>
 &nbsp; Action created with number #559 and attached.<br>
&gt; @link getin = 1967<br>
 &nbsp; Linked to 1967 Corvette Sting Ray(#558V)<br>
&gt; drop 1967<br>
 &nbsp; Dropped.<br>
&gt; getin<br>
 &nbsp; 1967 Corvette Sting Ray(#558V)<br>
====================================
</code></p>

<p>To describe the interior of the vehicle, use the <code>@idesc</code>
command:</p>

<p><code>
====================================<br>
&gt; @idesc here = The 'vette's interior is pristine: gleaming chrome,<br>
 &nbsp; smooth blue vinyl, and rubbery floormats.<br>
&gt; look<br>
 &nbsp; The 'vette's interior is pristine: gleaming chrome, smooth blue<br>
 &nbsp; vinyl, and rubbery floormats.<br>
====================================
</code></p>

<p>You do not need to create an action that takes you out of the vehicle:
the server command <code>leave</code> will do this for you.</p>

<p>You do, however, need to set up an action that will let you control the
vehicle. The action will work by forcing the vehicle, so it needs to be
set <code>X(forcible)</code> and <code>force_locked</code> to you.</p>

<p><code>
====================================<br>
&gt; @set 1967 = X<br>
 &nbsp; Flag set.<br>
&gt; @flock 1967 = me<br>
 &nbsp; Force lock set.<br>
====================================
</code></p>

<p>If you wanted anyone to be able to drive the vehicle, you would need to
set the force lock to something that would succeed for all players, such
as <code>@flock 1967 = !#0.</code>  </p>

<p>To make an action that controls the vehicle, create an action as
normal, attached to the vehicle, lock it to a condition that always
fails, and set its <code>@fail</code> message with <code>MPI</code> that
forces the vehicle to act as specified by the action's argument:</p>

<p><code>
====================================<br>
&gt; @act drive = 1967<br>
  Action created with number 560 and attached.<br>
> @lock drive = me&!me<br>
  Locked.<br>
> @fail drive = {force:#558,{&arg}}<br>
  Message set.<br>
> drive :vroom vrooOOOOmms!<br>
  Outside> 1967 Corvette Sting Ray vroom vrooOOOmms!<br>
> drive n<br>
  Outside> 
  <font color="red">
  ( ... the vette goes north; we see the appropriate output
  </font>
  )<br>
====================================
</code></p>

By default, all emits outside the vehicle will be broadcast to the
vehicle's interior, prepended with the string <code>outside&gt;.</code>
You can change this prepend string with the <code>@oecho</code> command:

<p><code>
====================================<br>
 &nbsp; (Outside the vehicle, Holbrook waves.)<br>
 &nbsp; Outside> Holbrook waves.<br>
<br>
> @oecho 1967 = >>><br>
 &nbsp; Message set.<br>
<br>
 &nbsp; (Holbrook waves again for us.)<br>
 &nbsp; >>> Holbrook waves again.<br>
====================================
</code></p>

<p>Note: Soft-coded look, pose, and say commands may alter the behavior of
vehicles from what is described here.</p>
