<p><b>5.0 ADMINISTERING A MUCK</b></p>

<p>Putting a <code>MUCK</code> online, creating a world that will
attract players, and dealing with the minor and major crises that will
inevitably crop up over time is an inherently demanding and
time-consuming task. For most, though, it is a labor of love, and the
burdens can be shared among staff members. Administering a
<code>MUCK</code> involves both technical and non-technical issues. Both
can be quite insistent and pressing during a <code>MUCK's</code> early,
formative stages: there are innumerable technical details to attend to,
and the small population creates an artificially incestuous atmosphere
in which non-technical issues &#151; especially personality conflicts
&#151; easily get blown out of proportion. As the world develops and
attracts players, things stabilize, but both issues will remain. On the
technical side, problems of dbase management and backward compatibility
will replace the tasks of getting everything working right. On the
non-technical side, player relations and changing levels of commitment
from staff members will come to the fore. Both sets of issues are
discussed in this section of the Manual. </p>
