<p><b>1.5  Setting Up Your Character</b><p>

<p>A new character is essentially a blank slate, having only a name, a
dbref, a password, a flag or two, and some pennies. In order to become a
fully functioning part of the <code>MUCK</code> world, you will need to
do a few things to get your character set up. The following section
describes a very basic set up. Most of the things you'll do in this
section involve setting `properties'. A property is a named location on
a <code>MUCK</code> object where information is stored. Properties are
discussed fully in <a href="props.html">Section 2</a>; you don't need to
understand exactly how <code>MUCK</code> handles properties in order to
set up your character. Any commands you issue at this stage are
reversible, so don't worry about making mistakes. Simply re-enter the
command correctly.</p>
