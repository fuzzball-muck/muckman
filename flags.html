<p><b>Flags:</b></p>

<p>Flags &#151; also called `bits' &#151; provide an economical way to
store important information about all objects in the database.</p>

<p>Usually you can see both the dbref and flags of any objects you
control when they appear in a Contents or Inventory list, or in the case
of rooms, simply by doing a look. Whether or not you can see this
information is determined by the <code>S</code> flag set on your
character: type <code>@set me =!S to</code> see dbrefs and flags, or
<code>@set me = S</code> to hide them (in this context, the
<code>S</code> flag means `Silent').  Whether you are set
<code>Silent</code> or not, you can see the flags set on an object you
control by examining it.</p>

<p>The first flag listed after an object's dbref is its `type flag'. The
type flag functions differently than any remaining flags. It determines
the type of the object; it is set at the time of the object's creation;
it cannot be changed; and it determines the meaning or function of
remaining flags. If an object is created with the <code>@dig</code>
command, it will be a room and will have an <code>R</code> flag in the
first position. If it is created with the <code>@action</code> or
<code>@open</code> command, it will be an exit and will have an
<code>E</code> flag.  If it's created with the <code>@program</code>
command, it will be a program and will have an <code>F</code> flag. If
it's created with the <code>@pcreate</code> command, it will be a player
and have a <code>P</code> flag. If it's created with the
<code>@create</code> command, it will be a thing, and will have none of
these flags.  All flags are either `set' or `not set' at all times.</p>

<p>The meaning or function of the remaining flags depends on their
context... that is, on what type flag the object has. For example, if a
program (something with an <code>F</code> flag in the first position) is
set <code>D,</code> the <code>D</code> flag means `Debug', and debugging
information is shown whenever the program runs. If a room (something
with an <code>R</code> flag in the first position) is set
<code>D,</code> the <code>D</code> flag means `Dark': the `Contents'
list won't appear for a player who doesn't control the room, and no
notices are emitted when players connect and disconnect in the room. In
short, the same flag won't always mean the same thing. While the
context-dependent meanings of flags can be confusing for new users, it
provides an elegantly economical way to store important information. The
meanings of each flag in relation to the type flags are listed in <a
href="flagref.html">Section 2.5.</a></p>

<p>The type flag is set at the time of an object's creation. The
remaining flags can be toggled with the <code>@set</code> command and
the `not operator' (an ! exclamation point). The syntax for setting a
flag is <code>@set &lt;object&gt; = &lt;flag&gt;</code>. For removing a
flag, it's <code>@set &lt;object&gt; = !&lt;flag&gt;</code>. Flags are
not case sensitive: <code>@set here = D</code> and <code>@set here =
d</code> produce the same result.</p>

<p><code>
====================================<br>
&gt; @set here = D<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Flag set.<br>
&gt; @set here = !D<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Flag reset.<br>
====================================<br>
</code></p>

<p>Mortals' use of flags is restricted in a few ways. Most importantly,
they can only set flags on things they control. Players cannot change
the state of the <code>Zombie</code> (<code>Z</code>) or
<code>Dark</code> (<code>D</code>) flags on themselves. They cannot set
themselves or anything they own <code>Builder</code> (<code>B</code>) or
<code>Wizard</code> (<code>W</code>). They must have a Mucker bit (flags
<code>M1,</code> <code>M2,</code> or <code>M3</code>) in order to change
the Mucker bit of a program. Players can set the Mucker bit of a program
they own to a level lower than or equal to their own, but not higher.
Wizard's control all objects and may change the state of any flag on any
object, with two exceptions: (<code>1</code>) type flags can never be
changed; (<code>2</code>) if the <code>MUCK</code> is compiled with the
<code>god_priv</code> option (which it usually is), wizards cannot set
players <code>W</code> or <code>!W</code>.</p>
