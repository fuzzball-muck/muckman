<p><b>1.4.3  Talking</b></p>

<p>The <code>say</code> command (abbreveated as a " quotation mark) causes your
character to say something hearable by all other characters in the same
room. Thus, if Cara's player types...</p>

<p><code> &nbsp; &nbsp; say Hi there! </code></p>

<p>or </p>

<p><code> &nbsp; &nbsp; "Hi there!</code></p>

<p>people in the same room will see </p>

<p><code> &nbsp; &nbsp; Cara says, "Hi there!"</code></p>

<p>Characters can communicate via gestures or `poses' as well as speech.
The <code>pose</code> command (abbreated as a : colon) causes your
character to do something seeable by all other characters in the same
room. So, if Cara's player types... </p>

<p><code> &nbsp; &nbsp; pose waves.</code></p>

<p>or </p>

<p><code> &nbsp; &nbsp; :waves.</code></p>

<p>people in the same room will see </p>

<p><code> &nbsp; &nbsp; Cara waves.</code></p>

<p>The pose command handles punctuation intelligently, omitting the
space between the character's name and the pose when the text begins
with punctuation. Thus, if Cara's player typed...</p>

<p><code> &nbsp; &nbsp; :'s going to go see a friend</code> </p>

<p>characters around her would see... </p>

<p><code> &nbsp; &nbsp; Cara's going to go see a friend.</code></p>

<p>rather than </p>

<p><code> &nbsp; &nbsp; Cara 's going to go see a friend.</code></p>

<p>You can communicate with a specific player, or a group of players,
rather than the whole room, via the <code>whisper</code> command
(abbreviated as `w' or `wh'). The syntax is <code>w &lt;name or
names&gt; = &lt;message&gt;</code>  For example, if Clearsong's player
typed </p>

<p><code> &nbsp; &nbsp; w cashmere = What say we blow this joint?</code></p>

<p>...Cashmere would see... 

<p><code> &nbsp; &nbsp; Clearsong whispers, "What say we blow this
joint?" (to<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; you)</code></p>

<p>If Clearsong's player had typed <code>w cashmere cara = I thought
that was illegal.</code>, both Cashmere and Cara would receive the
whisper. To format a whisper as a pose, put a colon before the whispered
message. For example, Cashmere could answer Clearsong by typing... </p>

<p><code> &nbsp; &nbsp; w clearsong = :nods.</code> </p>

<p>Whisper will search the room for partial name matches. Thus, if there
is no one else named Clear&lt;something&gt; present, typing <code>w
clear = :nods</code> would send the whisper to Clearsong.  The whisper
command `remembers' the last person you whispered to, so to continue a
whispered conversation, the name may be omitted: <code>w =
&lt;message&gt;</code>.</p> 

<p>You can communicate with people in other rooms via the
<code>page</code> command (abbreviated as `p'). The syntax for pages,
page poses, and pages to multiple players is the same as that of
whisper: <code>p &lt;name or names&gt; = &lt;message&gt;</code> (for a
page) and <code>p &lt;name or names&gt; = : &lt;pose&gt;</code> (for a
page pose).  Like whisper, the page `remembers' the last person you
paged to and the name may be omitted.</p>

<p>(Note: Spaces have been placed around the = equal sign in the above
examples for clarity. The spaces are not necessary, but can be
included.)</p>
