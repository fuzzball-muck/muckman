<p><b>2.3  Overview: Exits and Locks</b></p>

<p>An `exit' is a link between two objects on a <code>MUCK.</code> When
the two objects are rooms, the exit creates a virtual `door' between
them. When the destination is a program, the exit serves as a
user-created command.  Other combinations are possible. Exits are also
called `actions'. Use of exits (as well as objects of other types) is
controlled by `locks': an expression that evaluates as either `true' (in
which case the exit/object can be used) or `false' (in which case it
cannot). An exit is characterized by having a starting point (an object
to which it is `attached') and a destination point (an object to which
it is `linked').  </p>

<p><b>Exits</b></p>

<p>Exits are created with either the <code>@open</code> or
<code>@action</code> command. Both create an exit (an object with type
flag E), but the syntax and defaults are slightly different.</p>

<p>The basic syntax of the <code>@open</code> command is <code>@open
&lt;exit name&gt;</code>.  An exit created in this way will be attached
to (i.e., start from) the room in which one issues the command, and it
will not be linked to anything (it won't lead anywhere). The exit can be
linked to another object on the <code>MUCK</code> with the
<code>@link</code> command, syntax <code>@link &lt;exit name&gt; =
&lt;destination&gt;</code>. Since the destination will usually be
somewhere else on the <code>MUCK,</code> it will need to be specified by
dbref rather than name.</p>

<p>
Hooking up an exit in two steps... <br>
<code>
====================================<br>
&gt; @open out<br>
&nbsp;  Exit opened with number #1766.<br>
&gt; @find hallway<br>
&nbsp;  Ansley Inn, Hallway(#198R)<br>
&nbsp;  1 objects found.<br>
&nbsp;  ***End of List***<br>
&gt; @link out = #98<br>
&nbsp;  Linked to Ansley Inn, Hallway(#98R)<br>
====================================<br>
</code></p>

<p>
Hooking up an exit in one step...<br>
<code>
====================================<br>
&gt; @open out = #98<br>
&nbsp;  Exit opened with #1766.<br>
&nbsp;  Linked to Ansley Inn, Hallway(#198R)<br>
====================================<br>
</code></p>

<p>An exit does not have to be attached to a room, however: an exit can
be attached to anything except a program or another exit. The
<code>@action</code> command (abbreviated as <code>@act</code>) creates
an action/exit attached to an object specified at the time of
creation:</p>

<p><code>
====================================<br>
&gt; @act myplace = me<br>
&nbsp;  Action created with number #1236 and attached.<br>
&gt; @link myplace = #1234 <br>
&nbsp;  Linked to Cashmere's Den(#1234).<br>
====================================<br>
</code></p>

Many <code>MUCKs</code> have a soft-coded <code>@action</code> command,
that allows you to specify both the source and destination at the time
of the exit's creation:</p>

<p><code>
====================================<br>
&gt; @act myplace = me,#1234<br>
&nbsp;  Action created with number #1236 and attached.<br>
&nbsp;  Trying to link...<br>
&nbsp;  Linked ot Cashmere's Den(#1234)<br>
====================================<br>
</code></p>

<p>The attachments and links of exits can be changed. To relink an exit,
issue the <code>@unlink</code> command and then <code>@link</code> the
exit to the new destination.</p>

<p><code>
====================================<br>
&gt; @unlink myplace<br>
&nbsp;  Unlinked.<br>
&gt; @link myplace = #1768<br>
&nbsp;  Linked to Cashmere's Bachelor Pad(#5784R).<br>
====================================
</code></p>

<p>To change an exit's point of attachment, use the <code>@attach</code>
command, syntax <code>@attach &lt;exit&gt; = &lt;new attachment
point&gt;</code></p>

<p><code>
====================================<br>
&gt; @attach refrigerator = here<br>
&nbsp;  Action re-attached.<br>
====================================<br>
</code></p>

<p>(Obvious-exit programs generally list exits in the order of
first-attached to last-attached, or the reverse. Therefore, the order in
which exits appear on the list can be changed by using
<code>@attach</code> to re-attach exits to the room: the exit will then
become the last-attached exit, and move to either the first or last
position in the list.)</p>

<p>To reiterate, exits have a source (the object to which they are
attached) and a destination (the object to which they are linked). This
means that they are <em>one way</em>. This point often causes confusion
for new builders: in order to create a `door' between two rooms, one
needs to create two exits, one leading in each direction. The following
example illustrates this: <code>Cashmere's Bachelor Pad</code> has dbref
<code>#5784.</code> From the Bachelor Pad, he will create a Bedroom, and
then create two exits that make a door between the Pad and the
Bedroom.</p>

<p><code>
====================================<br>
&gt; @dig Cashmere's Bedroom<br>
&nbsp;  Cashmere's Bedroom created with #5792.<br>
&nbsp;  Parent set to BD's Environment Room(#4989RA).<br>
&gt; @open Bedroom = #5792<br>
&nbsp;  Exit opened with number #5793.<br>
&gt; bedroom<br>
&nbsp;  Cashmere's Bedroom(#5792)<br>
&gt; @open Out = #5784<br>
&nbsp;  Exit opened with number #5784.<br>
&nbsp;  Linked to Cashmere's Bachelor Pad(#5784R).<br>
====================================
</code></p>

<p>Exits linked to things move the the thing to the point of attachment
when used (rather than moving the user to the thing).</p>

<p><code>
====================================<br>
&gt; @act getpup = me<br>
&nbsp;  Action created with number #4684 and attached.<br>
&gt; @link getpup = $pup<br>
&nbsp;  Linked to Squiggy(#128629XZ).<br>
&gt; getpup<br>
&nbsp;  done<br>
&gt; i<br>
&nbsp;  You are carrying:<br>
&nbsp;  Squiggy(#128629XZ)<br>
&nbsp;  You have 10664 wet cats.<br>
====================================<br>
</code></p>

<p>Exits' names can include `aliases', other names that can be used as
the exit name. An existing exit can be renamed to include aliases with
the <code>@name</code> command, or the aliases can be specified at the
time of the exit's creation.</p>

<p>
Renaming an existing exit...<br>
<code>
====================================<br>
&gt; @name bedroom = Bedroom &lt;B&gt;;bedroom;bed;b<br>
&nbsp;  Name set.<br>
====================================
</code></p>
  
<p>
Creating an exit with aliases...<br>
<code>
====================================<br>
&gt; @open Out &lt;O&gt;;out;ou;o<br>
&nbsp;  Exit opened with number #5785.<br>
====================================
</code></p>

<p>Each string separated by a ; semi-colon is an alias for the exit. In
the `out' example above, typing either <code>out &lt;o&gt;, out,
ou,</code> or <code>o</code> would cause the player to use the out
exit. Only the first name or alias is shown a list of obvious exits. The
above examples follow the common and useful convention of supplying a
`full' exit name along with a simple abbreviation in the first
alias.</p>

<p><code>
====================================<br>
&gt; look<br>
&nbsp;  Cashmere's Bachelor Pad(#5784R)<br>
&nbsp;  Obvious Exits:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Bedroom &lt;B&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Out &lt;O&gt;<br>
====================================<br>
