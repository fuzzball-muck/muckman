<p><b>2.1.2  Messages and Message Properties</b></p>

<p>As indicated earlier, a set of properties in the <code>_/</code>
directory is given special handling by the server. They can be set with
a group of server commands such as <code>@succ,</code>
<code>@ofail,</code> etc., and they cause strings to be parsed and
displayed automatically whenever certain events happen.  Collectively,
this group of commands, properties, and their values are called
`messages'.</p>

<p><pre>
    <em>Command/Message Type       Property</em>
    @desc                      _/de
    @succ                      _/sc
    @osucc                     _/osc
    @fail                      _/fl
    @ofail                     _/ofl
    @drop                      _/dr
    @odrop                     _/odr
    @pecho                     _/pecho
    @oecho                     _/oecho
</pre></p>

<p>(There does not seem to be a definitive pronunciation for messages:
when speaking in RL, some people would say `at-fail' for
<code>@fail,</code> and others would say simply `fail'.)</p>

<p>The <code>@desc</code> message is evaluated and displayed to any user
who looks at an object of any type.</p>

<p><code>
====================================<br>
&gt; @desc me = A nymph with green hair.{look-notify}<br>
&nbsp;  Message set.<br>
&gt; l me<br>
&nbsp;  [ Kiri looked at you. ]<br>
&nbsp;  A nymph with green hair.<br>
====================================<br>
</code></p>

<p>The <code>@succ</code> message is evaluated and displayed to any user
who successfully uses an object. The meaning of `success' varies
depending on the object type. To successfully use a thing or a program
means to pick it up. To successfully use a room means to look at it. To
successfully use an exit means to pass through it or use it as a command
that triggers a program. To successfully use a player means to steal one
of her pennies with the <code>rob</code> command.</p>

<p><code>
====================================<br>
&gt; @succ out = You step out back.<br>
&nbsp; Message set.<br>
&gt; out<br>
&nbsp; You step out back.<br>
====================================<br>
</code></p>

<p>The <code>@osucc</code> message is evaluated and displayed to all
players in a room where a player successfully uses the object, <em>other
than</em> the player in question. The <code>@osucc</code> message (that
is, the string stored in the object's <code>_/osc</code> property) is
prefaced with the user's name when it is displayed.</p>

<p><code>
====================================<br>
&gt; @osucc out = steps out back.<br>
&nbsp; Message set.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;  (Kiri types `out'... others see...)<br>
&nbsp;  Kiri steps out back.<br>
====================================<br>
</code></p>

<p>The <code>@fail</code> is evaluated and displayed to a user who fails to
successfully use an object. The normal reason for failure is that the
object is locked against the player. The terms for success or failure
are those indicated above, for <code>@succ</code>.</p>

<p><code>
====================================<br>
&gt; @fail vault = Ahem. Only authorized bank employees may open the<br>
&nbsp;  vault. Various alarms begin to sound. <br>
&nbsp; Message set.<br>
&gt; @lock vault = ~banker:yes<br>
&nbsp;  Locked.<br>
&gt; vault<br>
&nbsp;  Ahem. Only authorized bank employees may open the vault.<br>
====================================<br>
</code></p>

<p>The <code>@ofail</code> message is evaluated and displayed to all
players in a room where a player fails to successfully use the object,
<em>except</em> the player in question. The <code>@ofail</code> message
is prefaced with the user's name when it is displayed.</p>

<p><code>
====================================<br>
&gt; @ofail vault = tried to open the vault! Shrill alarms begin ringing!<br>
&nbsp;  Message set.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;  (Kiri types `vault'... others see...)<br>
&nbsp;  Kiri tried to open the vault! Shrill alarms begin ringing!<br>
====================================<br>
</code></p>

<p>The <code>@drop</code> message is evaluated and displayed to a player
who triggers a drop. For a thing or program, a drop is triggered when
the object is dropped. For a room, a drop is triggered whenever an
object is dropped in the room. For an exit, a drop is triggered when a
player (or other object type) passes through th exit (using an
exit/action linked to a program does not trigger a drop).  For a player,
a drop is triggered when he or she is killed.</p>

<p><code>
====================================<br>
&gt; @drop grenade = BANG!<br>
&nbsp;  Message set.<br>
&gt; drop grenade<br>
&nbsp;  BANG!<br>
====================================<br>
</code></p>

<p>The <code>@odrop</code> message is is evaluated and displayed to all
players in a room where a player drops an object, except for the
triggering player, or all other players in the room a player arrives in
when she passes through an exit. The <code>@odrop</code> message is
prefaced with the user's name when it is displayed.

<p><code>
====================================<br>
&gt; @odrop out = comes out of the house.<br>
&nbsp;  Message set.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;  (Kiri types `drop out'... the players in the outside room see...)<br>
&nbsp;  Kiri comes out of the house.<br>
&nbsp;  Kiri has arrived.<br>
<br>
&gt; @odrop grenade = drops a grenade! Run! {null:{delay:3,{lit:<br>
&nbsp;  {null:{tell:BANG!}}}}}<br>
&nbsp;  Message set.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;  (Kiri types `drop grenade'... others see...)<br>
&nbsp;  Kiri drops a grenade! Run!<br>
&nbsp;  BANG!<br>
====================================<br>
</code></p>

<p><code>@pecho</code> and <code>@oecho</code> are somewhat different
than the preceding messages, having to do with the format of messages
transmitted (or `broadcast') by puppets and vehicles.</p>

<p>By default, output broadcast from a puppet is prefaced by the
puppet's name and a &gt; greater than sign. Typing <code>@pecho
&lt;puppet name&gt; = &lt;new preface string&gt;</code> sets the puppet
object's <code>_/pecho</code> property, which will become the new
preface string. (See <a href="puptut.html">Section 4.3</a> for more
information on creating puppets.)</p>

<p><code>
====================================<br>
&gt; z look<br>
&nbsp;  Squiggy&gt; Amberside Inn, Tavern<br>
&nbsp;  Squiggy&gt; At first glance the tavern seems little changed from <br>
&nbsp;  Squiggy&gt; days when pirate sloops sought haven in the protected <br>
&nbsp;  Squiggy&gt; coves of Amberside's cliffs: the beams are still low <br>
&nbsp;  Squiggy&gt; and smoke-stained...<br>
<br>
&gt; @pecho squiggly = *<br>
&nbsp;  Message set.<br>
<br>
&gt; ex squig = _/<br>
&nbsp;  str /_/pecho:*<br>
&nbsp;  1 property listed.<br>
<br>
&gt; z look<br>
&nbsp;  * Amberside Inn, Tavern<br>
&nbsp;  * At first glance the tavern seems little changed from days when <br>
&nbsp;  * pirate sloops sought haven in the protected coves of Amberside's <br>
&nbsp;  * cliffs: the beams are still low and smoke-stained...<br>
====================================<br>
</code></p>

<p>By default, messages broadcast from the exterior of a vehicle object
to its interior will be prefaced by the string <code>Outside&gt;
</code>. Typing <code>@oecho &lt;vehicle object&gt; = &lt;new preface
string&gt;</code> will set the vehicle's <code>_/oecho</code> property,
which will become the new preface string. (See <a
href="vehicletut.html">Section 4.5</a> for more information on creating
vehicles.)</p>

<p><code>
====================================<br>

&gt; @set 1967 = V<br>

&nbsp;  Outside&gt; Squiqqy raps sharply on the window... "Can you hear <br>
&nbsp;  me in there, mistress?"<br>
<br>
&gt; @oecho here = &gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&nbsp;  Message set.<br>
<br>
&gt; z :raps again. "What about now?"<br>
&nbsp;  &gt;&gt;&gt; Squiggy raps again. "What about now?"<br>
