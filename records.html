<p><b>5.2.7 Record Keeping</b></p>

<p>Your <code>MUCK</code> is itself a large, complex set of records, and
most information you would need to record is automatically recorded,
either in log files or the database itself. There is, though, one record
that most administrators find extremely useful that <code>MUCK</code>
itself has no mechanism for: player's email addresses. Life will be much
easier if you religiously follow a practice of recording email addresses
each time you run <code>@pcreate.</code> This will let you notify
players of things like downtime and address changes, and &#151; if you
follow a policy of not accepting character requests from anonymous email
sites such as Hotmail, Rocketmail, Yahoo, etc. &#151; gives you some
chance of identifying alternate characters controlled by the same
player.</p>

<p>You can store this online (on the player object, in a property such
<code>as @/email),</code> but it is more valuable to keep the record
offline, so that you can access it if the <code>MUCK</code> goes down...
which is a prime example of when you would need the players' email
addresses. A flat text file works fine for this.</p>

<p>One other kind of record keeping may prove useful. It is occasionally
necessary to issue warnings to players about <code>AUP</code>
infringements, and the like.  In order for such warnings to be a useful
administrative measure, other wizards need to know about warnings you
have issued. A common and workable practice is to use a program that
stores administrative notes about such matters in a wizard-only propdir
on player objects.  With it, you can see if any other wizards have noted
<code>AUP</code> problems with a player before you decide what an
appropriate response to an incident is. (An example of such a program is
provided <a href="wizlog.html">here</a>.)</p>
