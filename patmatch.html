<p><b>2.1.6  Pattern Matching and Output Types</b></p>

<p>As indicated, the <code>@find</code> command can be used to locate
items with a given name. For more flexible searches, you can use pattern
matching (a limited version of regular expressions) to find objects
whose name matches a certain pattern, rather than matching the name
string literally. A pattern consists of logical and grouping operators,
wildcard characters, and/or literal characters. <code>@Find</code>
&#151;and the related search commands <code>@owned, @contents</code>,
and <code>@entrances</code> &#151; can be used with a subset of standard
regular expression conventions, and additional parameters that specify
`output types' (parameters for values such as memory used, time since
used or modified, etc.)</p>

<p>Suppose that you have created a Coral Reef area, with interesting
scenery and games: players try to avoid sharks, wrestle octopi, and find
sunken treasure before they run out of breath and are forced to return
to the surface. To use the rooms and games, a player must have a
snorkle. You have set up a <code>`make snorkle'</code> action linked to
an <code>M2</code> program that changes an object into a snorkle (it
sets all the properties used by your games). And, you have a Snorkle
Rental Booth: a room where can people rent snorkles or read `The
Complete Book of Snorkles' and `Field Guide to the Lesser Coral Reef'
(help on how to use the area). The reef rooms have names like `Coral
Reef, Sandy Wash' and `Coral Reef, Moray's Lair'. Occassionally, you
need to find these objects... to recall and update your snorkles or
track down your wandering shark-bot, for example.</p>

<p>You can use literal matches to find objects whose name includes the
string you are trying to match. Matching is not case-sensitive.</p>

<p>The <code>*</code> and <code>?</code> wildcard characters allow you
to search for names that match a pattern, rather than a literal string.
The <code>*</code> asterix wildcard (sometimes called a `glob') matches
any zero or more characters; the <code>?</code>  question mark matches
any single character.</p>

<p>You could find your two cave rooms in the coral reef area (and leave
out other cave rooms you might have) by beginning putting a glob between
`Coral' and `Cave'.</p>

<p><code>
====================================<br>
&gt; @find coral*cave<br>
&nbsp;  Coral Reef, Weed-Shrouded Cave(#812RJ)<br>
&nbsp;  Coral Reef, Dark Cave(#817RJ)<br>
&nbsp;  ***End of List***<br>
&nbsp;  2 objects found.<br>
====================================<br>
</code></p>

<p>You could find all the reef rooms, leaving out the book `Field Guide
to the Lesser Coral Reef', by searching for `reef' followed by a
<code>?</code> question mark, which would require that there be at least
one character after the string `reef'.</p>

<p><code>
====================================<br>
&gt; @find reef?<br>
&nbsp;  Coral Reef, Sandy Wash(#802RJ)<br>
&nbsp;  Coral Reef, Moray's Lair(#805RJ)<br>

</code></p>

<p>The <code>{curly braces}</code> grouping operators delimit word
patterns. To find all your snorkle objects and the `<code>make
snorkle</code>' action, but omit `The Complete Book of Snorkles', you
could delimit `snorkle' as a word, and not simply a string.</p>

<p><code>
====================================<br>
&gt; @find {snorkle}<br>
&nbsp;  Snorkle Rental Booth(#856RJ)<br>
&nbsp;  make snorkle(#857ED)<br>

&nbsp;  Snorkle 5(#883)<br>
&nbsp;  Snorkle 6(#884)<br>
&nbsp;  Snorkle 7(#885)<br>
&nbsp;  Snorkle 8(#886)<br>

====================================<br>
</code></p>

<p>One can search for objects whose names include words from a group of
valid words by separating the words with the `or' operator, a
<code>|</code> vertical bar. For example, you could find all objects
that include the words `sunken' or `surface'.</p>

<p><code>
====================================<br>
&gt; @find {sunken|surface}<br>
&nbsp;  Coral Reef, Near the Surface(#809RJ)<br>
&nbsp;  Coral Reef, Sunken Hull(#815RJ)<br>
&nbsp;  ***End of List***<br>
&nbsp;  2 objects found.<br>
====================================<br>
</code></p>

<p>The <code>[square brackets]</code> grouping operators delimit
character groups or ranges or characters. </p>

<p>A group of characters in square brackets are treated as valid single
characters. A find for <code>`coral reef, [wdn]'</code> would find the
coral reef rooms with either `w', `d', or `n' following the string
`coral reef,
`.</p>

<p><code>
====================================<br>
&gt; @find coral reef, [wdn]<br>
&nbsp;  Coral Reef, Near the Surface(#809RJ)<br>
&nbsp;  Coral Reef, Weed-Shrouded Cave(#812RJ)<br>
&nbsp;  Coral Reef, Dark Cave(#817RJ)<br>
&nbsp;  ***End of List***<br>
&nbsp;  3 objects found.<br>
====================================<br>
</code></p>

<p>Instead of typing each valid character, you can also designate a
range of valid characters, such as <code>[0-9],</code>
<code>[a-z],</code> or <code>[A-Z].</code> You could find all your
snorkle objects, which all have a numeric character following the string
`Snorkle `, by using <code>[0-9]</code> as the range of characters.</p>

<p><code>
====================================<br>
&gt; @find snorkle [0-9]<br>
&nbsp;  Snorkle 1(#854)<br>
&nbsp;  Snorkle 2(#859)<br>
&nbsp;  Snorkle 3(#881)<br>
&nbsp;  Snorkle 4(#882)<br>
&nbsp;  Snorkle 5(#883)<br>
&nbsp;  Snorkle 6(#884)<br>
&nbsp;  Snorkle 7(#885)<br>
&nbsp;  Snorkle 8(#886)<br>
&nbsp;  Snorkle 9(#887)<br>
&nbsp;  Snorkle 10(#888)<br>
&nbsp;  Snorkle 11(#889)<br>
&nbsp;  Snorkle 12(#890)<br>
&nbsp;  ***End of List***<br>
&nbsp;  12 objects found.<br>
====================================<br>
</code></p>

<p>Note that the <code>[square brackets]</code> delimit <em>character
ranges</em>, not <em>numeric ranges</em>. A find for <code>`snorkles
[1-12]'</code> won't work...  or won't work as one might intend. It
finds all objects with either characters in the range of <code>`1 to
1'</code> or the character <code>`2'</code> following the string
`snorkles `.</p>

<p><code>
====================================<br>
&gt; @find snorkle [1-12]<br>
&nbsp;  Snorkle 1(#8454)<br>
&nbsp;  Snorkle 2(#8459)<br>
&nbsp;  snorkle 10(#8488)<br>
&nbsp;  snorkle 11(#8489)<br>
