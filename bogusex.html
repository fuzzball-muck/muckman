<p><b>2.3.1  Bogus Exits</b></p>

<p>It is (or was) a relatively common practice to create lookable
details and realism-enhancing actions in rooms by means of `bogus
exits'... exits that do not lead anywhere. The exits can be given a
description, so that doing <code>look &lt;exit&gt;</code> shows some
detail of the room, and realistic messages can be put in the exit's
<code>@fail/@ofail</code> or <code>@succ/@osucc</code>.</p>

<p><code>
====================================<br>
&gt; @open Grandma's Rocker;grandmas rocker;rocker;chair;sit<br>
&nbsp;  Exit opened with number #5797.<br>
&gt; @link chair = $nothing
&nbsp;  Linked to gen-nothing(#114).<br>
&gt; @desc chair = An old, old rocker that has been in the family <br>
&nbsp;  for generations.<br>
&nbsp;  Description set.<br>
&gt; @succ chair = You take a seat in the old rocker.<br>
&nbsp;  Message set.<br>
&gt; @osucc chair = takes a seat in the old rocker.<br>
&nbsp;  Message set.<br>
====================================<br>
</code></p>

<p>The above example creates a `virtual chair'. Though it will not
appear in the room's Contents list, people can look at it, and can sit
in it by typing <code>sit</code> (or any of its other aliases).

<p>Bogus exits may have their place, but builders should be aware that
there are other ways of accomplishing the same goals without creating a
separate exit for each item (an approach that quickly leads to dbase
bloat). Lookable details can created with `looktraps' (see <a
href="looktraps.html">Section 2.2.2</a>) and many events like the `sit'
message in the above example can be handled by a single action (See <a
href="mpiex.html">Section 3.1.2</a>, <code>MPI</code> Examples).</p>
