<p><b>2.5  Flag Reference</b></p>

<dl>
<code><p><dt>A (Abode, Abate, Autostart)</p></code>
<dd><p><em>On a Room</em>: Anyone can set their home or the home of
objects to the room.</p>
  
<dd><p><em>On an Exit</em>: The exit is lower priority than an exit
without the <code>Abate</code> flag. If
<code>compatible_priorties</code> is tuned to `no', an abated exit's
priority is `less than 0'; If <code>compatible_priorites</code> is tuned
to `yes', an abated exit's priority is `less than 1'.</p>

<dd><p><em>On a Program</em>: The program will automatically be loaded
into memory and executed when <code>the</code> <code>MUCK</code> starts
or restarts.</p>


<code><dt>B (Builder, Bound, Block)</code>

<dd><p><em>On a Player</em>: Player can create and modify objects with
the <code>@create, @dig,  @link</code>, and <code>@open.</code> On most
<code>MUCKs,</code> players start off with a <code>B</code> flag. A
<code>B</code> flag on players is also called a `builder bit'.</p>

<dd><p><em>On a Room</em>: Personal exits (exits attached to a player)
cannot be used in the room.</p>

<dd><p><em>On a Program</em>: Any functions within the program run in
preempt mode. If the program set <code>B</code> is called by another
program, multi-tasking status returns to that of the calling program
when execution exits from the called program.</p>

<dd><p>(Only wizards can set and remove B flags.)</p>


<code><dt>C (Chown_OK, Color)</code>

<dd><p><em>On any object except Players</em>: Anyone can take control of
the object with the @chown command (`change ownership').</p>
  
<dd><p><em>On a Player</em>: On <code>MUCK</code> versions
<code>5.x</code> and lower, no effect.  on 6.x, <code>MUCK</code> output
will be formatted with <code>ASCII</code> color, provided that the
player's client handles color and that the text has been formatted with
color.</p>


<code><dt>D (Dark, Debug)</code>

<dd><p><em>On a Room</em>: Wizards and the owner of the room see all
objects normally, but other players see only objects they own. If no
objects would be seen, a `Contents' list is not appended to the
description of the room.</p>

<dd><p><em>On a Thing</em>: The object does not appear in the room's
`Contents' list.</p>

<dd><p><em>On a Player</em>: The player does not appear in the
`Contents' list of rooms or in the <code>WHO</code> list. Only wizards
may set players dark.</p>

<dd><p><em>On a Program</em>: A stack trace of internal program
operations is printed out to anyone who uses the program.</p>


<code><dt>E (Exit)</code>

<dd><p><em>Type Flag</em>: The object is an Exit/Action.</p>


<code><dt>F (MUCK Forth Program)</code>

<dd><p><em>Type Flag</em>: The object is a program.</p>


<code><dt>H (Haven, HardUID)</code>

<dd><p><em>On a Room</em>: The <code>kill</code> command may not be used
in that room.</p>

<dd><p><em>On a Player</em>: The player cannot be paged.</p>

<dd><p><em>On a Program</em>: The program runs with the permissions of
the owner of the trigger, rather than with the permissions of the user
of the program. When this is set in conjunction with the
<code>Sticky</code> (<code>Setuid</code>, below) flag on a program, and
the program is owned by a wizard, then it will run with the effective
mucker level and permissions of the calling program. If the caller was
not a program, or the current program is <em>not</em> owned by a wizard,
then it runs with <code>Setuid</code>.</p>


<code><dt>J (Jump_OK)</code>

<dd><p><em>On a Room</em>: Players can teleport to and from the room
(assuming other conditions for teleporting are met). If the
<code>MUCK</code> is configured with <code>secure_teleporting,</code>
<code>J</code> indicates that exits attached to players and objects can
be used to leave to leave the room, and <code>!J</code> indicates that
they cannot.</p>

<dd><p><em>On a Thing</em>: The object can be moved by a program running
at any Mucker level.

<dd><p><em>On a Player</em>: The player can teleport to and from rooms
(assuming other conditions for teleporting are met).</p>


<code><dt>K (Kill_OK)</code>

<dd><p><em>On a Player</em>: The player can be killed with the
<code>kill</code> command. A player who is `killed' is simply sent
home.</p>


<code><dt>L (Link_OK)</code>

<dd><p><em>On a Room</em>: Anyone can link exits to the room.</p>

<dd><p><em>On a Program</em>: The program can be called by any program,
and can be triggered by actions and propqueues not owned by the owner of
the program.</p>


<code><dt>M1 (Mucker Level 1)</code>  (See also <a
href="mucklev.html">Section 3.2.1</a>)

<dd><p><em>On a Player</em>: The player is an `apprentice' Mucker. He
can use the <code>MUF</code> editor and create <code>M1</code>
programs.</p>

<dd><p><em>On an Exit</em>: The exit runs at priority 1.</p>

<dd><p><em>On a Program</em>: The program runs with Mucker level 1
permissions. The program cannot get information about or send
information to any object that is not in the same room. Some
<code>MUF</code> primitives cannot be used. Program output to anyone
except the triggering player is prepended with the triggering player's
name.  Instruction count is limited to about 20,000 instructions. The
program follows permissions for protected props (see <a
href="specprops.html">Section 2.1.1</a>).</p>


<code><dt>M2  (Mucker Level 2)</code>  (See also <a
href="mucklev.html">Section 3.2.1</a>)

<dd><p><em>On a Player</em>: The player is a `journeyman' Mucker. She
can use the <code>MUF</code> editor and create <code>M2</code> programs.
She can set the Mucker level of any program she controls to
<code>M1</code> or <code>M2.</p></code>

<dd><p><em>On an Exit</em>: The exit runs at priority 2.</p>

<dd><p><em>On a Program</em>: The program runs with Mucker level 2
permissions. Some <code>MUF</code> primitives cannot be used.
Instruction count is limited to about 80,000 instructions. The program
follows permissions for protected props (see Section 2.1.1).</p>


<code><dt>M3  (Mucker Level 3)</code>  (See also <a
href="mucklev.html">Section 3.2.1</a>)

<dd><p><em>On a Player</em>: The player is a `master' Mucker. He can use
the <code>MUF</code> editor and create <code>M3</code> programs. He can
set the Mucker level of any program he controls to <code>M1,</code>
<code>M2,</code> or <code>M3.</code> </p>

<dd><p><em>On an Exit</em>: The exit runs at priority 3.</p>

<dd><p><em>On a Program</em>: The program runs with Mucker level 3
permissions. Almost all <code>MUF</code> primitives can be used. There
is no absolute limit to instruction count, unless the program is running
in <code>PREEMPT</code> mode. The program may over-ride the permissions
for protected props.</p>

<code><dt>P  (Player)</code>

<dd><p><em>Type Flag</em>: The object is a Player.</p>


<code><dt>Q  (Quell)</code>

<dd><p><em>On a Player or Room</em>: The <code>Quell</code> flag cancels
the effects of a wizard flag. A wizard player set <code>Q</code> is
effectively a normal player.  A <code>Q</code> flag on a wizbitted room
will cancel the realms-wiz powers of the room's owner.</p>


<code><dt>R  (Room)</code>

<dd><p><em>Type Flag</em>: The object is a Room.</p>


<code><dt>S  (Silent, Sticky, SetUID)</code>

<dd><p><em>On a Thing</em>: The object will return to its home when
dropped.</p>

<dd><p><em>On a Room</em>: The room's drop-to is delayed until all
players have left the room.</p>

<!-- <dd><p><em>On an Exit</em>: If the exit is attached to a thing and
linked to another thing &lt;&lt;&lt;check&gt;&gt;&gt;</p> -->

<dd><p><em>On a Player</em>: The player will not see dbrefs on things
she owns, and will not see objects in a <code>Dark</code> room. Control
is unchanged however.</p>

<dd><p><em>On a Program</em>: The program runs with the permissions of
the owner of the program, and not those of the user.</p>


<code><dt>W (Wizard)</code>

<dd><p><em>On a Room</em>: The room's owner has Realms Wiz powers in
that room and any rooms parented to it, provided that the
<code>MUCK's</code> <code>realms_control</code> parameter is set to
`yes'.</p>

<dd><p><em>On an Exit</em>: The exit runs at priority 4.</p>

<dd><p><em>On a Player</em>: The player is a wizard. Wizards have
control over all objects in the database (although with some
restrictions in their control over God and other wizards). Wizards can
use restricted, wiz-only commands, and can set programs, rooms, and
things <code>W</code> and <code>B.</code> Some wizard powers are enabled
or disabled by the system parameter <code>god_priv</code>.</p>

<dd><p><em>On a Program</em>: The program is effectively Mucker level 4.
All <code>MUF</code> primitives may be used, and do not have a maximum
instruction count unless the program is running in preempt mode.</p>


<code><dt>X (Xforcicble)</code>

<dd><p><em>On a Player or Thing</em>: The player or thing may be forced
by a player (or other object type) to which it is

in the room.</p>

<dd><p><em>On an Exit</em>: Zombies may not use the exit.</p>
