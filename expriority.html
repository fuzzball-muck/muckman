<p><b>2.3.3  Exit Priorities</b></p>

<p>In our discussion of the environment tree, it was noted that the
server searches up the environment tree for commands matching users'
input. If more than one command with the same name is found, the server
must resolve which command to execute. This is determined by the
`priority' of the exits, and the order of the search path. Both are
affected by the system parameter <code>compatible_priorities</code>.</p>

<p>Wizards can set Mucker bits on exits as well as on programs and
players. An exit with a higher Mucker bit runs at higher priority than
an exit with a lower Mucker bit, or one with no Mucker bit. </p>

<p>For example, suppose a <code>MUCK</code> has a global exit named
`bank' linked to a program  that gives players 100 pennies, and a player
has an exit in his room named `bank' linked to a program that gives
players 500 pennies. If neither exit has a Mucker bit set, both are
considered `Priority 0' (zero). The <em>first</em> exit found in the
search path would be executed: a player standing in the room with the
`local' exit would receive 500 pennies; elsewhere, the global `bank'
command would run, and the player would receive 100 pennies.</p>

<p>However, if a wizard set the global `bank' exit <code>M1,</code> the
global exit would now have higher priority. Even in the room with the
`local' exit, typing `bank' would execute the global exit, and players
would receive 100 pennies.</p>

<p>As indicated, if there are two exits with the same name and the same
priority, the server executes the <em>first</em> exit found. But the
order of the search path changes depending on whether the system
parameter <code>compatible_priorities</code> is set to `no' or `yes'.
(Wizards may set system parameters with the <code>@tune</code>
command.)</p>

<p>If <code>compatible_priorities</code> is set to `no', all
non-prioritied exits (i.e., exits with no Mucker bit set) are considered
`priority 0', and the server uses the following search order:</p>

<ol>
  <li>On the room the player is located in
  <li>On objects the player's inventory
  <li>On objects in the room's inventory
  <li>On the player
  <li>Environment rooms containing the present room, beginning with the `closest' room... the room furthest from room <code>#0</code>
  <li>Room <code>#0</code>
  <li>The server
</ol>

<p>If <code>compatible_priorities</code> is set to `yes', all
non-prioritied exits are considered `priority 1', and the server uses
the following search order:
  
<ol>
  <li>On the room the player is located in
  <li>On the player
  <li>Environment rooms containing the present room, beginning with the `closest' room... the room furthest from room <code>#0</code>
  <li>Room <code>#0</code>
  <li>Objects in the player's inventory
  <li>Objects in the room's inventory
  <li>The server
</ol>

<p>In our example, the wizard had just set the global `bank' exit
<code>M1,</code> so it had a higher priority than the local
<code>M0</code> exit. If the wizard then did <code>@tune
compatible_priorities = yes</code>, both exits would now be considered
`priority 1': the global is priority 1 because it is set
<code>M1,</code> and the local is considered priority 1 because the
system parameter is set to run all unprioritied exits at priority 1. The
search order for players and inventories has changed, but in both cases
the local room is checked before the global parent <code>#0.</code> So,
now the local exit would run when player's type `bank' in the room with
the local exit. If the wizard then set the global exit <code>M2,</code>
it would again have higher priority than the local exit, and would run
regardless of where a player is standing when typing `bank'.</p>

<p>If you have difficulty getting a local or personal exit to run in
preference to a global of the same name, contact a wizard and discuss
modifying priorities, either by raising your exit's priority, or by
changing the system parameter.</p>
