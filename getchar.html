<p><b>1.3  Getting a Character</b></p>

<p>The <code>MUCK</code> server has a provision for automatic character
generation, but usually this is disabled. Instead, you'll need to send
email requesting a character. The contents of the email you send will
vary from <code>MUCK</code> to <code>MUCK:</code> some simply ask for
the character name you want, others require your real name, your age,
and your state or country of residence. Help files on the
<code>MUCK</code> or people online should give you more specific
information. Typing <code>news registration</code> or <code>news join
for</code> a helpfile or <code>staff</code> for a list of people
responsible for answering such questions are good first steps for
finding this information.</p>

<p>Once your character is approved and created, you will be sent email
containing the character's name (usually the name you asked for) and
your password. Sometimes you request a password; sometimes it is
randomly assigned. Random passwords may be changed to something
memorable once you connect. Passwords are case-sensitive: `flipFlap' and
`flipflap' are two different passwords.</p>

<p>Character creation by this method usually takes a day or two.</p>

<p>On <code>MUCKs</code> that allow automatic character creation, use
the <code>create</code> command at the log on screen:</p>

<p><code>
====================================<br>
&gt; create Cashmere flipFlap<br>
====================================<br>
</p></code>
