<p><b>5.2.8  The Last Word</b></p>

<p>Throughout, <em>The MUCK Manual</em> has discussed the numerous
technical effects of the <code>Wizard</code> bit being set on a player. But
wizbits often have another, nontechnical effect: they can greatly aggravate
any tendency the player has toward arrogance and pomposity. Do your players a
favor... Do <em>yourself</em> a favor: guard constantly against thinking that
being a wizard makes you special. The best <code>MUCK</code> wizards treat the
job as "glorified janitor", with the emphasis on "janitor".</p>
