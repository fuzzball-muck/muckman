<p><b>Linking to the Rest of the Muck: Worst-Case Scenario</b></p>

<p>If you want to link your home to the rest of the <code>MUCK,</code>
and no programs or staff members are able to do this for you, you will
need to work in concert with another player (the owner of the room where
you want your home to be). The two of you will create two exits: one
leading from your home to the other person's room, and one leading from
the other person's room to your home. By working together, you will be
able to work within a basic security restriction: a player may not
attach an exit in a room owned by someone else.</p>

<p>There are a number of ways to accomplish this, and a number of
different orders in which the steps could be performed. The method and
order in the following example will work fine. Cashmere has dug his den,
and he has found a place where he'd like to put his home: The Deep Dark
Woods, owned by Fin. Cashmere and Fin go to the Deep Dark Woods together
and begin. Both players will set their rooms <code>Link_OK,</code> so
that others may make exits that lead to them. Fin will make an exit in
the Woods, leading to the Den (she owns the Woods, so she can make an
exit there, and the Den is set <code>Link_OK,</code> so she can link the
exit to the Den).  Cashmere will use the new exit to go to his Den. From
there, he will make an exit leading out to the Woods (he owns the Den,
so he can make an exit there, and the Woods are set
<code>Link_OK,</code> so he can link the exit to the Woods)</p>

</code></p>

<p>Finally, note that it is quite feasible to simply move in with
someone else. All that is necessary is that the other player's home be
set <code>A</code> or <code>Abode.</code> This flag lets other players
set it as their homes.  To do so, simply go there and type <code>@link
me = here</code>.</p>
