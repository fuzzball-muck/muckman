<p><b>3.2  Overview: MUF (cont'd)</b></p>

<p><b>Putting it All Together</b></p>

<p>You make a <code>MUF</code> program do what it is supposed to by defining
functions and directing program flow with conditional statements and loops.
There are a number of fine points, but these are the heart of <code>MUF</code>
programming.  Once you have a good grasp of these, you are past the hard part.
</p>

<p>Now we will tinker with tinker.muf until it becomes a useful program,
along the way covering most of the issues you will face in
<code>MUF.</code> We will make tinker.muf into a program that checks all
the exits in a room and makes sure that they have <code>@succ,</code>
<code>@osucc,</code> <code>@odrop,</code> and <code>@desc</code>
properties.</p>

<p>First we'll do a rudimentary version with no error checking to
concentrate on new topics, then a final version. Enter the following
code in your program. </p>

====================================
</pre></p>

<p>The first line in function <code>main</code> uses the predefined
<code>loc</code> variable to put the dbref of the user's location on the
stack, and then uses the <code>EXITS</code> primitive to put the first exit in
the room onto the stack (the room's dbref is used up). The exit's dbref is then
stored in the local variable <code>ourExit.</code></p>

<p>This is followed by a loop. The first line in the loop tests the exit
condition: while there is a value in the <code>ourExit</code> variable,
the loop will continue to execute.</p>

<p>The next line fetches the value out of <code>ourExit</code> and
places it on the stack. Then, the value is duplicated and tested four
times, once for each message we're interested in.</p>

<p><pre>
  dup "_/de"  getpropstr not if
    desctell
  then
</pre></p>

<p><code>DUP</code> puts an extra copy of the exit's dbref on the stack,
to be used in an <code>IF</code> test, leaving the first copy on the
stack. Here, <code>GETPROPSTR</code> puts the value of the exit's
<code>_/de</code> property on the stack... the exit's desc. We want to
tell the user <code>IF</code> the exit <em>doesn't</em> have a desc, so
we reverse the truth value of the top item on the stack with
<code>NOT</code>. If the room <em>does</em> have a desc, the desc string
will be on the stack... and a string other than <code>""</code> is true.
The <code>NOT</code> will replace this string with <code>0</code> zero,
and the <code>IF</code> test will be false... execution will jump to the
line following then. However, if the exit <em>doesn</em>'t have a desc,
the top item on the stack will be a <code>""</code> null string. The
<code>NOT</code> will replace this with a <code>1</code> one, for
`true'.  In this case, the <code>IF</code> test will be true, and the
code between <code>IF</code> and its corresponding <code>then</code>
will execute: the program will execute the function
<code>desctell.</code></p>

<p>The same process is then repeated for each of the messages we're
interested in: <code>@succ,</code> <code>@osucc,</code> and
<code>@odrop.</code></p>

<p>Exiting this loop is controlled by the next primitive.
<code>NEXT</code> takes the dbref of an exit or thing, and returns the
next exit or thing in the room's inventory. So, the line... </p>

<p><pre>
  ourExit @ next ourExit !
</pre></p>

<p>Fetches the dbref of the current exit, gets the next exit, and stores
that one in the <code>ourExit</code> variable.</p>

<p>Execution then jumps back to the top of the loop: while we still have
exits to check, the loop will continue to execute. But, when we run out
of exits, there will be nothing in the <code>ourExit</code> variable.
the <code>WHILE</code> test will be false, and execution will jump out
of the loop.</p>
